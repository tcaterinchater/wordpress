ASK KATHLEEN SEBELIUS. IT IS WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 6th,  AND THIS IS &quot;NOW.&quot; &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt;&gt; THIS MORNING HHS SECRETARY  KATHLEEN SEBELIUS RETURNED TO  HER OWN PRIVATE HAITES ON THE  HILL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; USER ARE RECEIVING FAR FEWER  ERROR MESSAGES. WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS, BUT  THERE&#39;S STILL A LOT OF WORK TO  DO. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; STILL, THE PROGRESS WAS NOT  ENOUGH TO SPARE THE SECRETARY  FROM THE PANEL&#39;S REPUBLICAN  INQUISITION, INCLUDING SENATOR  HATCH, WHO BERATED SEBELIUS FOR  HER CAVALIER ATTITUDE AND ISSUED A PRESUMABLY NONIRONIC  INVITATION TO APPEAR BEFORE THE  COMMITTEE EVERY MONTH FOR THE  NEXT SIX MONTHS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THERE IS A LONG TRACK RECORD  OF BROKEN PROMISES AND  UNTRUTHFUL ANSWERS TO BOTH THIS  COMMITTEE AND THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE WITH RESPECT TO HOW THIS  LAW SHOULD WORK OR WOULD WORK  AND THE IMPACT IT WOULD HAVE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE PRESIDENT PROMISED IF YOU LIKE YOUR DOCTOR, YOU CAN KEEP  YOUR DOCTOR. AGAIN, MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE FINDING OUT THEY CAN&#39;T KEEP  THEIR DOCTOR. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; TO PROTECT THE  ADMINISTRATION, YOU CHOSE TO  IGNORE THESE WARNINGS, AND AS A  RESULT YOU HAVE PUT OUR ENTIRE  HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND ONE-SIXTH OF OUR ECONOMY IN JEOPARDY. I REPEAT MY REQUEST FOR YOU TO  RESIGN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; FOR THEIR PART, DEMOCRATS  RAILED AGAINST THE PROBLEMS IN  THE COUNTRY&#39;S EXISTING HEALTH  CARE SYSTEM AND EMPHASIZED THE  EXPANDED COVERAGE AVAILABLE  UNDER THE NEW LAW. INDEED, THE FIXATION ON  GLITCHES, DROPPED PLANS, AND  COLLECTIVE RATE SHOCK --  THE NEWS MEDIA HAS A NATURAL  ATTRACTION TO BAD NEWS OVER  GOOD. MILLIONS SET TO GAIN LOW-COST  INSURANCE IS A LESS ATTRACTIVE  STORY THAN FLORIDA WOMAN FACING  HIGHER COSTS. RATE SHOCK IS A MIDDLE-CLASS  PROBLEM, SO IT GETS LOTS OF  ATTENTION, NOTES KEVIN DRUM. AND AS &quot;THE NEW YORK TIMES&quot;  NOTES, WHO IS TALKING ABOUT THE  FACT THAT 7 MILLION AMERICANS  ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FREE POLICIES? A NEW STUDY FINDS THAT 5 MILLION 06 MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE  UNINSURED WILL QUALIFY FOR  SUBSIDIES THAT WILL BE GREATER  THAN THE COST OF THE CHEAPEST  SILVER OR BRONZE PLAN. THAT&#39;S NOT EVEN COUNTING THE  MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO WILL  NOW QUALIFY FOR MEDICAID. ON THAT NOTE, PRESIDENT OBAMA  HEADS TO TEXAS THIS AFTERNOON  WHERE HE&#39;LL PRESS GOVERNOR RICK  PERRY TO PUT POLITICS ASIDE AND  EXPAND MEDICAID TO POOR MEN AND  WOMEN IN THE LONE STAR STATE. JUDGING BY THE LAST MONTH, GOOD  LUCK WITH THAT. JOINING ME TODAY, WASHINGTON  BUREAU CHIEF AT THE HUFFINGTON  POST, RYAN GRIM, SYNDICATED  COLUMNIST KATHLEEN PARKER, AND  MSNBC HOST RONAN FARROW. RYAN, I WILL START WITH YOU. I KNOW &quot;THE HUFFINGTON POST&quot; CAN SOMETIMES FOCUS INTENTLY ON  REPUBLICAN FAILURE. I THINK THE NEWS MEDIA HAS BEEN  ACTUALLY FAIRLY EVEN HANDED IN  THE AFFORDABLE -- IN THE  COVERAGE OF AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. BUT HAS THE MEDIA BEEN TOO EVEN  HANDED AS FAR AS GIVING AIR TIME TO GLITCHES AND BROKEN PROMISES  AND NOT TRULY FOCUSING ON WHAT  THE LAW IS DOING AT LARGE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK IT&#39;S BEEN ONE OF THE  MOST EMBARRASSING EXPERIENCES  FOR THE MEDIA IN A LONG TIME. THEY KEPT DRAGGING OUT THESE  PEOPLE AND SAYING, YOU KNOW,  LOOK AT THE DEVASTATION THAT WAS VISITED UPON THIS WOMAN IN  FLORIDA OR WHEREVER BECAUSE  SHE&#39;S GETTING HER POLICY  CANCELED AND NOW SHE&#39;S IN ALL  SORTS OF TROUBLE. BUT THEN IF YOU LOOK A LITTLE  BIT PAST IT, OH, WELL, ACTUALLY  HER INSURER MIGHT HAVE LIED TO  HER AND SHE&#39;S ACTUALLY ELIGIBLE  FOR COMPARABLE OR BETTER  INSURANCE AT LESS COST. I MEAN, THERE&#39;S NO QUESTION THAT SOME PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, HAD SOME  PLANS THAT THEY LIKED THAT WERE  CHEAP AND WERE LOUSY AND WON&#39;T  BE ABLE TO AFFORD SOME OF THE  BETTER PLANS. THOSE ARE SOME OF THE PEOPLE  THAT ARE SUBSIDIZING OTHER  PEOPLE TO GET INSURANCE. YOU KNOW, NOBODY LIKES TO BE  FORCED TO SUBSIDIZE OTHER  PEOPLE. BUT THAT&#39;S THE MINORITY. THE FACT THAT THE MEDIA HAS SUCH A HARD TIME OF FINDING BAD  EXAMPLES SHOULD GIVE THEM SOME  EVIDENCE --  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I DON&#39;T KNOW. DO THEY? I FEEL LIKE FOX NEWS HAS HAD AN  EASY TIME OF FINDING BAD  EXAMPLES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THEN YOU CALL THEM AND  THEY&#39;RE LIKE, OH, I DIDN&#39;T KNOW  I WAS ELIGIBLE FOR THIS. IT&#39;S EASY TO FIND BAD EXAMPLES  IF YOU DON&#39;T CARE ABOUT THE  FACTS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BUT NARRATIVE IN THIS COUNTS. PART OF THIS IS PROVING TO  AMERICANS THAT THIS HEALTH  INSURANCE IS A GOOD THING, THAT  THEY CAN ACTUALLY ENROLL IN IT  USING A COMPUTER OR A PAPER  FORM, WHICH WILL ACTUALLY STILL  TAKE A LONG TIME. AND IF YOU DON&#39;T HAVE ENOUGH  PEOPLE BUY INTO THE NOTION THAT  THIS THING IS FUNCTIONING, THEN  THE WHOLE THING CAN FAIL. IF YOU LOOK AT THE ENROLLMENT  GOALS, AND I&#39;M PERSONALLY SORT  OF TERRIFIED WHEN THE WHITE  HOUSE DOES RELEASE THE NUMBERS  LATER THIS MONTH. THE GOAL IS 800,000 BY NOVEMBER  30th. I AM NOT A MATHEMATICIAN, BUT  THAT NUMBER, GIVEN THE FACT THAT SIX PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO ENROLL  ON THE FIRST DAY, COULD BE  DREADFULLY LOWER THAN 800,000. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND I WOULD ADD AN EXTRA  TERRIFYING TARGET. THEY NEED 40% OF THE ENROLLEES  TO BE YOUNG PEOPLE. THAT DEMOGRAPHIC IS PARTICULARLY CRITICAL. THAT&#39;S THE DEMOGRAPHIC MOST  TURNED OFF BY THESE TYPE OF TECH ILLITERACY GLITCHES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HOW DO THEY GET OVER THAT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH CARE, YOUNG, HEALTHY PEOPLE ARE  TYPICALLY THE LAST TO SIGN UP. THESE INITIAL NUMBERS, AS  FRIGHTENING AS THEY ARE, AND  THEY WILL BE LOWER THAN THE  SMALL NUMBERS EXPECTED, DON&#39;T  MATTER THAT MUCH IN THE LONG  RUN. IN MASSACHUSETTS, YOUNG PEOPLE  WERE AMONG THE LAST TO SIGN UP  BECAUSE THE INITIAL WAVE OF  PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE THOSE WHO NEED IT MOST URGENTLY. UNTIL THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE START  LINING UP LATER IN THE GAME, WE  NEED TO NOT TURN THEM OFF OF THE SYSTEM. ALL OF THE PUNDITS WHO ARE  EXPLOITING THIS FOR POLITICAL  GAIN NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY  UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM WILL BE UP AND RUNNING AND YOU DO NEED TO  SIGN UP FOR YOUR SAKE SO WE  DON&#39;T HAVE UNINSURED YOUNG  PEOPLE AND SO WE&#39;RE NOT  SHOULDERING THE BURDEN OF  EMERGENCY CARE FOR ALL THOSE  PEOPLE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; KATHLEEN, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF ALL THIS? THERE ARE SKEPTICS. THERE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE  SKEPTICS WHEN THERE ARE BIG  PIECES OF LEGISLATION. THIS LEGISLATION SHOULD NOT BE  WITHOUT ITS SKEPTICISM GIVEN HOW IT&#39;S BEEN ROLLED OUT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. I HAVE A COUPLE THINGS TO SAY IN RESPONSE TO YOUR POINT, THE  YOUNG PEOPLE SIGNING UP. THE WAY TO PUSH THAT IS TO  APPEAL TO PARENTS. PARENTS WILL ULTIMATELY HAVE TO  FOOT THE BILL IF THEIR KID GETS  HURT OR HAS SOME CATASTROPHIC  EVENT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND PARENTS CAN BUG THEIR  CHILDREN TOO. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; MY SON IS SORT OF  LIBERTARIANISH. HE SAID, WHY WOULD I EVEN DO IT? THE PENALTY IS MINOR. I SAID, YOU&#39;RE GOING TO DO IT  BECAUSE I DON&#39;T WANT TO PAY YOUR MEDICAL BILLS. BUT LET ME GET TO ANOTHER POINT. I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WANT TO  PUSH TOWARD THE NARRATIVE OF  LOOK HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE GETTING COVERAGE THAT NEED IT. I&#39;M CERTAINLY NOT A PERSON WHO  WISHES TO DENY THOSE PEOPLE  HEALTH COVERAGE, BUT I DO THINK  THE WAY THE THING IS ROLLED  OUT -- FORGET THE COMPUTER. THAT CAN BE RESOLVED AT SOME  POINT. BUT THE FACT THAT THE  ADMINISTRATION WAS NOT  FORTHCOMING ABOUT HOW THIS THING WOULD, IN FACT, WORK, WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN WRONG WITH SAYING WHEN THE PRESIDENT&#39;S PRESENTING THE  PLAN -- AND THIS IS A DEBATE  THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE WHITE  HOUSE, AND THEY OPTED TO MAKE  THE PROMISE THAT EVERYONE COULD  KEEP THEIR PLAN, KNOWING FULL  WELL THAT WAS NOT GOING TO BE  THE CASE. SO WHY NOT -- WHY COULDN&#39;T HE  HAVE JUST SAID, LOOK, NOT  EVERYBODY IS GOING TO KEEP THE  PLAN THEY HAVE BECAUSE WE&#39;VE  CHANGED THE LAW. WE HAVE CERTAIN STANDARDS. BUT IF YOU LOSE YOUR POLICY,  YOU&#39;RE GOING TO GET A BETTER  ONE. AND SOME PEOPLE MAY PAY A LITTLE MORE. WE HOPE IT&#39;S NOT TOO PAINFUL. IF YOU&#39;LL BEAR WITH US AS WE  PUSH THIS THING THROUGH, IT&#39;S  GOING TO BE A BETTER SITUATION  FOR EVERYONE. AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN -- YOU  KNOW, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN  ACTUALLY HANDLE THE DETAILS. THE FORMER SPEECH WRITER SAID,  WE DIDN&#39;T WANT TO GET INTO THE  DETAILS BECAUSE WE DIDN&#39;T WANT  TO CONFUSE PEOPLE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE WANTED TO SAY THE SIMPLEST THING THAT WAS STILL THE TRUTH,  WHICH REMINDED ME OF KEITH  ALEXANDER SAYING WE WANTED TO  SAY THE LEAST UNTRUTHFUL -- I  WANT TO GIVE THE LEAST  UNTRUTHFUL RESPONSE I CAN GET. I DON&#39;T MEAN TO CONFLATE THE ACA WITH THE NSA AND INTELLIGENCE  GATHERING, BUT IT IS KIND OF AN  EMERGING NARRATIVE FROM THE  WHITE HOUSE ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THE SORT OF POLITICS WERE VERY MUCH  AT PLAY HERE, JAKE. AND WE ACTUALLY FOUND THE  ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE. HILLARY CLINTON WAS ASKED  REPEATEDLY IN 2007 ABOUT HER  HEALTH CARE PLAN AND SAID OVER  AND OVER AGAIN TO WARD OFF  REPUBLICAN DETRACTORS, YOU&#39;RE  GOING TO BE ABLE TO KEEP YOUR  PLAN. THIS IDEA THAT AMERICANS WERE  GOING TO LOSE THE HEALTH  INSURANCE PLANS THAT THEY  COVETED REGARDLESS OF HOW BAD  THEY WERE WAS A LINE OF  LEGITIMATE CRITICISM IN THE 2008 RACES. I THINK IT SORT OF, LIKE, THAT  IS WHERE THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN  LEARNED THAT THEY NEEDED TO HAVE A SORT OF IRON-CLAD ALIBI, IF  YOU WILL, AGAINST THE CRITICISM  THAT PEOPLE WERE GOING TO LOSE  THEIR INSURANCE REGARDLESS OF  WHETHER THEY WOULD OR NOT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THEY WANTED A SIMPLER  MESSAGE. WHEN HILLARY CLINTON DID HER  HEALTH CARE REFORM, BILL CLINTON HAD A CARD MADE UP THAT SAID,  THIS IS YOUR CARD THAT&#39;S YOUR  GUARANTEE OF HEALTH CARE. IT DIDN&#39;T MEAN ANYTHING. YOU KNOW? BUT IT&#39;S THE IDEA YOU HAVE TO  SIMPLIFY THIS TO SELL IT  POLITICALLY. IF YOU LOOK AT THE FAIRLY RECENT HISTORY OF THE ROLLOUT OF HEALTH CARE EXPANSIONS AND OF BIG NEW  SOCIAL PROGRAMS, THERE ARE  EXAMPLES ON BOTH SIDES. NONE OF THEM HAVE GONE WELL OF  THE ROLLOUTS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE&#39;VE LEARNED NOTHING ABOUT  ROLLING THEM OUT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THERE WAS MEDICARE, AND THEY  WERE INFINITELY SMALLER IN  SCALE. BUT MEDICARE PART D WENT  TERRIBLY. SENIORS WERE LOSING THEIR  COVERAGE. IT LOOKED REALLY BAD. IT KIND OF RESOLVED ITSELF AND  WORKED OUT OKAY. BEFORE THAT, ANOTHER EXPANSION  WAS PASSED OF MEDICARE. PEOPLE HAVE FORGOTTEN THIS. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO COVER MEDIGAP PROBLEMS. IT WAS SO UNPOPULAR ULTIMATELY  WITH THE PEOPLE IT WAS SUPPOSED  TO HELP, BASICALLY BECAUSE OF  SHORT-TERM CONFUSION. THEY ENDED UP REPEALING THE  PROGRAM. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT THE ANTI-TERROR  MESSAGE THAT THEY WERE  DELIVERING. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NO, BUT IT&#39;S GOING TO BE  GOING BADLY AT THIS STAGE. THAT&#39;S ALMOST A GIVEN. BUT A YEAR FROM NOW, WILL THIS  ALL BE WORKED OUT AND WE&#39;LL LOOK BACK AND SAY, WELL, THOSE ARE  THE HINKS YOU GET IN THE ROLLOUT OF A SOCIAL PROGRAM, OR LOOK  BACK AND SAY, YOU KNOW, IT WAS  REALLY SCREWED UP. I DON&#39;T THINK WE KNOW THE  ANSWER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IF YOU USE THE MEDICARE  EXCHANGES AS BELL WEATHER FOR  INSURANCE ENROLLMENT, A LOT OF  REPUBLICANS WERE AGAINST THAT. SOME OF THEM, IF NOT ALL OF  THEM, HAVE COME AROUND BECAUSE  THERE&#39;S A VERY REAL PRACTICAL  IMPLICATION TO NOT EXPANDING  MEDICARE COVERAGE TO IT THE  POOR. IN THE SAME WAY, IF THESE  EXCHANGES START WORKING AND  PEOPLE GET THEIR LOW-COST,  BETTER COVERAGE, IT&#39;S GOING TO  BE HARD TO CONTINUE TO RAIL  AGAINST THIS. I THINK AT SOME POINT. IS THAT WILDLY OPTIMISTIC? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT&#39;S RIGHT. I THINK THIS WILL BE REMEMBERED  PRIMARILY AS A FAILURE OF  MESSAGING. I THINK THOSE COMMENTS INDICATE  A LARGER SCALE MESSAGING  PROBLEM, WHICH STEMS FROM A LACK OF FAITH IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN HANDLE  THIS, THEY CAN UNDERSTAND IT. THE MOMENT THOSE HHS REGULATIONS ALTERING THE GRANDFATHER CLAUSE  CAME INTO THE PICTURE, WE NEEDED A FRANK CONVERSATION FROM THE  ADMINISTRATION. FRANKLY, THE FAILURE TO HAVE  THAT CONVERSATION HAS ALLOWED A  LOT OF OTHER BAD ACTORS TO STEP  INTO THE CONVERSATION. THAT&#39;S WHY WE SEE THESE  OPPORTUNISTIC PEOPLE COMING INTO THE PICTURE SAYING, LOOK, BEFORE THE MARKETPLACE OPENS, YOU SIGN  UP FOR A HIGHER PRIE EER PRICED PLAN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE PRESIDENT MET WITH  INSURERS YESTERDAY AT THE WHITE  HOUSE AND SAID, LISTEN, GUYS,  YOU CANNOT KEEP UPSELLING  PEOPLE. YOU HAVE TO BE HONEST. I TRY TO BE VERY AGNOSTIC AND  NONPARTISAN ON THIS SHOW, BUT  HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES. DON&#39;T HAVE A GREAT RECORD OF  DOING WELL BY THE PEOPLE ON  THESE ACTUAL PLANS. AS RONAN POINTS OUT, TALKING  POINTS MEMO HAS A WHOLE PIECE  ABOUT HOW THESE INSURERS ARE  SENDING OUT LETTERS MEANT TO  SCARE PEOPLE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU BUILT YOUR ENTIRE HEALTH  CARE REFORM AROUND INSURANCE  COMPANIES. THE INSURERS ARE ASKED TO  EXECUTE THIS POLICY THAT THEY  FOUGHT THE ENTIRE WAY AND THAT  THEY WERE DEEM NIEZED THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE PROCESS OF. THEY WERE THE LAST ONES TO COME  TO THE TABLE ON THIS. THEY BROUGHT IN THE DOCTORS, THE HOSPITALS, THE DRUG MAKERS,  EVERYBODY, BUT NOT THE INSURERS. SO NOW YOU WANT TO TRUST THE  INSURERS TO CARRY THIS OUT IN A  WAY THAT&#39;S MOST BENEFICIAL TO  YOU AND NOT NECESSARILY IN THEIR PROFIT INTEREST? I MEAN, IT SHOULDN&#39;T BE  SURPRISING. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ALL THE WHILE, BY THE WAY,  INSULTING THE INSURERS FOR THESE CRAPPY PLANS THEY&#39;VE BEEN  SELLING PEOPLE THE WHOLE TIME,  RIGHT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BUT THEY OUGHT TO BE CAREFUL  HERE BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THIS IS  KIND OF THE STAT US CAN QUO IS  UNACCEPTABLE. 50 MILLION UNINSURED,  SKYROCKETING PRICES, THIS IS THE CHANCE FOR KIND OF THE MARKET TO WORK THIS SYSTEM OUT. IF THIS STARTED WITH THE  HERITAGE FOUNDATION, NEWT  GINGRICH, IF THIS FAILS,  REPUBLICANS DON&#39;T HAVE AN  ALTERNATIVE. THE ALTERNATIVE IS SINGLE PAYER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO SAY  THAT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, THERE WE GO. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE INSURERS WANT THE SAME  THING OBAMA WANTS, WHICH IS MORE CUSTOMERS. THEY WANT THOSE UNINSURED  HEALTHY YOUNG PEOPLE TO SIGN UP  TOO. SO, YOU KNOW, THE IDEA -- I  MEAN, THEY ALSO WANT TO POSITION THEMSELVES TO CONTINUE TO MAKE  MONEY IF THIS FAILS. AND THEY&#39;RE LOOKING FOR ANY  OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE MONEY THEY  CAN. BUT THE IDEA THAT THEY&#39;RE AT  ODDS WITH THE PROGRAM I DON&#39;T  THINK IS RIGHT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THEY NEED MORE INVINCIBLES  LIKE RONAN FARROW. HE&#39;S THE TARGET AUDIENCE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND EVERYONE IS ON THE SAME  PAGE IN THOSE POLICY GOALS, BUT  THE CONGRESSMEN AND SENATORS WHO ARE EXPLOITING THIS FOR  POLITICAL GAIN RIGHT NOW ARE  LETTING US ALL DONE IN THAT  GOAL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; OH, WELL, YOU CAN GET OVER  THAT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ZINGERS GALORE. WE HAVE TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO  RONAN. CONGRATULATIONS. GREAT TO HAVE YOU ON THE SHOW. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; EXCITED TO BE HERE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CAN&#39;T WAIT FOR YOU TO COME  BACK. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; FEELING IS MUTUAL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AFTER THE BREAK, WHILE  VIRGINIA&#39;S KEN CUCCINELLI  CHAMPION THE HIS VIEWS ON  CONTRACEPTION, ABORTION,  DIVORCE, AND SODOMY -- A WINNING QUARTET -- NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR  AVOIDED DISCUSSING HIS SOCIALLY  CONSERVATIVE POSITIONS. TWO DIFFERENT APPROACHES, TWO  DIFFERENT RESULTS.

IN VIRGINIA, DEMOCRAT TERRY  McAULIFFE WARDED OFF HIS TEA  PARTY OPPONENT KEN CUCCINELLI BY A MARGIN THAT WAS MUCH THINNER  THAN EXPECTED AT 48 TO 45.5%. McAULIFFE OWED A DEBT OF  GRATITUDE TO THE FEMALE VOTERS. THE WOMEN WERE ENOUGH TO CARRY  McAULIFFE TO VICTORY. VIRGINIA&#39;S ELECTION WILL PROVIDE THE GOP, WHICH IS QUIETLY BUT  UNDOUBTEDLY, STILL INGAUGENGAGED IN A  CIVIL WAR ON SOME ISSUES. IN THE WAKE OF A REPUBLICAN-LED  GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN THAT  FURLOUGHED THOUSANDS OF  VIRGINIAENS, 56% OF THOSE  AFFECTED SUPPORTED McAULIFFE. BUT DEFENDERS OF CUCCINELLI WILL NOTE THEIR CANDIDATE REMAINED  THROUGHOUT THE RACE AT A MAJOR  SPENDING DISADVANTAGE AND  McAULIFFE WAS AIDED BY A  LIBERTARIAN CANDIDATE WHO  SIPHONED VOTES FROM CUCCINELLI. MEANWHILE, IN NEW JERSEY,  ESTABLISHMENT BUT NOT MODERATE  GOP GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE WON  BIG, TAKING HOME MORE THAN 60%  OF THE VOTE OVER DEMOCRATIC  OPPONENT BARBARA BUONO. UNSURPRISINGLY, REPUBLICAN PARTY ELDERS ARE FILLED WITH MIRTH  GIVEN THE BREADTH OF CHRISTIE&#39;S  WIN. WOMEN PREFERRED HIM BY 12%. CHRISTIE, UNLIKE CUCCINELLI,  NEVER RAN AS A SOCIAL  CONSERVATIVE AND CHRISTIE,  UNLIKE THE REST OF HIS PARTY IN  CONGRESS, HAS BENEFITTED FROM  COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF  THE AISLE WHO HAVE BEEN MORE  EAGER TO CUT DEALS. MOST IMPORTANTLY, CHRISTIE  DIDN&#39;T ACTUALLY HAVE A REAL  OPPONENT. NEITHER DEMOCRAT NOR REPUBLICAN. IN A POLITICAL LANDSCAPE THAT IS PREDICTABLE ONLY IN ITS LACK OF  PREDICTABILITY, ONE THING IS FOR SURE. WITH A BELAYINGERED PARTY LEADER ON THE LEFT AND EMBATTLED PARTY  ON THE RIGHT, THE HAND OF  FORTUNE REMAINS IN A SPIN. JOINING US FROM CHARLOTTESVILLE, VIRGINIA, IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE UVA CENTER FOR POLITICS AND  AUTHOR OF &quot;THE KENNEDY HALF  CENTURY.&quot; PROFESSOR, THANKS SO MUCH FOR  JOINING US. I WANT TO GET YOUR IMMEDIATE  THOUGHTS ABOUT THE RACE. IT WAS SO MUCH TIGHTER THAN  POLLS IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS HAD  SHOWED. WHAT WERE YOUR TAKEAWAYS FROM  IT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU KNOW, ONE OF MY  TAKEAWAYS IS I&#39;M GOING TO RELY  LESS ON POLLING AVERAGES IN THE  FUTURE. THE POLLING AVERAGE WAS 7%. McAULIFFE WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE A 7% CUSHION. I THINK THAT&#39;S WHAT MOST PEOPLE  WERE EXPECTING. I HAVE TO SAY THIS, THOUGH. THE PRIVATE McAULIFFE SURVEYS,  WHICH WERE DONE BY ONE OF NBC&#39;S  POLLSTERS, HE ALWAYS HAD IT TWO, THREE, FOUR POINTS. I DON&#39;T THINK THEY WERE  NECESSARILY EXPECTING A MARGIN  AS BIG AS THE PUBLIC POLLING  SUGGESTED. BUT YOUR EARLIER DESCRIPTION WAS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. WHY DID THE INCUMBENT ATTORNEY  GENERAL, WHO WON ALMOST 59% FOUR YEARS AGO, END UP FALLING SHORT  IN THIS PARTICULAR ELECTION,  RUNNING AGAINST SOMEBODY WHO HAD NOT BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH  VIRGINIA AND WHO HAD NEVER HELD  PUBLIC OFFICE. YOU HAVE TO START WITH THE  SOCIAL ISSUES. THERE&#39;S A REASON WHY NORTHERN  VIRGINIA, HIGHLY EDUCATED, HIGH  INCOME, 34% OF THE ENTIRE  STATE&#39;S VOTES, VOTED FOR  McAULIFFE BY A 20% MARGIN. IT WAS HUGE. IT WASN&#39;T JUST WOMEN. IT WAS ALSO MEN IN NORTHERN  VIRGINIA. THE SOCIAL ISSUES, ABORTION, GAY RIGHTS, CLIMATE CHANGE. THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT REALLY PUT THE NAILS IN CUCCINELLI&#39;S  COFFIN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; PROFESSOR, I&#39;M GOING TO OPEN  THIS UP TO OUR FOLKS IN NEW  YORK. KATHLEEN, WHAT&#39;S INTERESTING  ABOUT THE FEMALE VOTE IN  VIRGINIA IS WHILE McAULIFFE WON  IT ON WHOLE, THE SPLIT WAS  REALLY, AS IT WAS NATIONALLY IN  THE 2012 ELECTION, MARRIED WOMEN WENT FOR CUCCINELLI 51% TO 42%. HE WON MARRIED WOMEN BY NINE  POINTS. IT&#39;S WOMEN UNDER 30 McAULIFFE  WON, I THINK, BY ALMOST 20  POINTS. THERE&#39;S CLEARLY A DIVISION HERE  IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH THE  QUESTION OF ABORTION AND A LOT  OF SOCIAL ISSUES RESONATE AMONG  CERTAIN AGE GROUPS AND CERTAIN  PORTIONS OF THE ELECTORATE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. I THINK ONE THING THAT&#39;S  INTERESTING IN THIS CAMPAIGN IS  McAULIFFE ACTUALLY NEVER  MENTIONED THE WORD ABORTION IN  ANY OF HIS ADS. MOST PEOPLE IN VIRGINIA,  FRANKLY, THEY DON&#39;T WANT TO TALK ABOUT ABORTION. IT NEVER CAME UP EXCEPT TOWARD  THE END WHEN PLANNED PARENTHOOD  CAME IN AND DID THEIR ADS. THE FACT THAT THIS IS BEING  FRAMED AS AN ABORTION ELECTION  IS --  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BUT THERE WERE A LOT OF ADS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; McAULIFFE BARELY WON DESPITE  THE FACT HE WAS RUNNING AGAINST  A CANDIDATE FROM 1953, OKAY? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; OR 1853. DEPENDS ON YOUR CHOICE OF  CENTURY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY DID  NOT GIVE HIM MUCH MONEY. THEY GAVE HIM ONLY $3 MILLION. THEY GAVE McDONALD $9 MILLION. A FEW BUCKS MORE IN HIS  DIRECTION, HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN  ABLE TO WALK AWAY WITH THIS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND JAKE, CUCCINELLI LOST THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY. THE FUNDING ISSUE WAS A BIG  DEAL. McAULIFFE OUTSPENT HIM BY DOUBLE DIGITS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, McAULIFFE COULD ALSO  NOT GET SOMEONE LIKE CHRIS  CHRISTIE TO COME DOWN --  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CUCCINELLI COULDN&#39;T. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CUCCINELLI, I&#39;M SORRY. HE&#39;S NOT THAT MODERATE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE CAN REDUCE THIS RACE TO A  SENTENCE. IT&#39;S A FAMILIAR SENTENCE. REPUBLICANS LOSE WINNABLE RACE  BECAUSE THEY NOMINATED A NUT NUTBALL CANDIDATE. AN ESTABLISHED CANDIDATE COULD  HAVE WON THAT RACE EASILY. THAT&#39;S THE REASON THE  REPUBLICANS DON&#39;T CONTROL THE  SENATE RIGHT NOW. THEY PUT TEA PARTY CANDIDATES IN WHO COULDN&#39;T BEAT A CENTRIST  DEMOCRAT WHEN MODERATE  REPUBLICANS WOULD HAVE. THEY CAN KEEP DOING THIS AND  KEEP LOSING ELECTIONS OR DO WHAT CHRIS CHRISTIE IS DOING. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ON SOME LEVEL THAT MAKES  SENSE. CHRIS CHRISTIE, HE&#39;S A MODERATE. HE DID NOT CAMPAIGN WITH  CUCCINELLI. HE DIDN&#39;T HAVE TED CRUZ COME TO  HIS STATE. HE HAD SUSANNA MARTINEZ COME TO  HIS STATE, AND I HHE WON BY A HUGE  MARGIN. AT THE SAME TIME, AS WHACKY AS  KEN CUCCINELLI WAS, HE LOST BY  2.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT COOLING THE  BITTER BREW THAT IS THE TEA  PARTY, I&#39;M NOT QUITE SURE YOU  POINT AT THOSE NUMBERS AND  THERE&#39;S A DEFINITIVE, YOU KNOW,  DOOR SHUTTING ON THAT PART OF  THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, THERE&#39;S NO QUESTION THE TEA PARTY HAS ACTUALLY TAKEN  ENCOURAGEMENT FROM THE FACT  CUCCINELLI KEPT IT AS CLOSE AS  HE DID GIVEN WHAT KATHLEEN WAS  SAYING IS, THAT GIGANTIC MONEY  EDGE THAT McAULIFFE HAD OVER  CUCCINELLI. AND, YOU KNOW, ALL THAT&#39;S TRUE. TO SPEAK BRIEFLY TO MR.  WISEBERG&#39;S POINT, IF THE  REPUBLICANS HAD NOMINATED THE  INCUMBENT LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR,  WHO&#39;S A MODERATE CONSERVATIVE,  HIS NAME IS BILL BOWLING, I  THINK HE WOULD HAVE WON EASILY. BUT WHAT&#39;S REALLY TELLING IS HE  WITHDREW RATHER THAN EVEN  COMPETE WITH CUCCINELLI IN THE  CONVENTION THAT THE CUCCINELLI  BACKERS CALLED INSTEAD OF A  PRIMARY. EVERYONE&#39;S SAYING, OH, IF THEY  HAD A PRIMARY, THAT WOULD HAVE  SOLVED THEIR PROBLEM. NO, ACTUALLY, I THINK BOWLING  WOULD HAVE LOST TO CUCCINELLI IN A PRIMARY TOO. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND THAT&#39;S --  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S THE BASE OF THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY THAT MATTERS  TODAY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND RYAN, THE PRIMARY  PROCESS, RIGHT. THAT&#39;S THE BIG QUESTION FOR  CHRIS CHRISTIE. SO CHRIS CHRISTIE WINS AMONG  WOMEN. HE WINS SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT FROM LATINOS, AFRICAN-AMERICANS. HE GETS DEMOCRATS, 32, I THINK. BUT TODAY IN AN INTERVIEW WITH  JAKE TAPPER, HE SAYS, I&#39;M A  CONSERVATIVE, I&#39;VE GOVERNED AS A CONSERVATIVE IN THIS STATE,  WHICH IS NOT QUITE I&#39;M SEVERELY  CONSERVATIVE, BUT IT&#39;S REALLY  INTERESTING THAT THE DAY AFTER  HE&#39;S SORT OF WIDELY HAILED AS A  MODERATE, A CENTRIST, HE NEEDS  TO GO BACK AND PROVE HIS  CONSERVATISM. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BECAUSE NOW HE&#39;S HEADED  TOWARDS THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE BIG ENCHILADA. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I WOULD HAVE THIS TO SAY TO  THE TEA PARTY FOLKS WHO ARE  CELEBRATING GETTING CLOSE. YOU KNOW, NOBODY SHOULD BE PROUD OF LOSING ANY ELECTION TO TERRY  McAULIFFE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; POOR TERRY McAULIFFE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THIS IS ONE OF THE LEAST  ATTRACTIVE, LEAST POPULAR PEOPLE TO WIN A STATEWIDE RACE, ANY  STATE. THE POLLING ON THIS GUY WAS  COMPLETELY UPSIDE DOWN. PEOPLE DON&#39;T LIKE HIM. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; RIGHT. SO MAYBE THE FLIP IS THAT HE DID AS BADLY AS HE DID TO THE  PROFESSOR&#39;S POINT. TERRY McAULIFFE WAS NO BIG  VIRGINIA STATESMAN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE PERSONALITY IS SO  IMPORTANT. THAT&#39;S WHY CHRIS CHRISTIE&#39;S  POPULAR. YES, HE&#39;S PRO-LIFE, BUT HE  DOESN&#39;T TALK ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW, HE JUST HAS A  GREGARIO GREGARIOUS, LIKABLE PERSONALITY. EVERYONE I&#39;VE TALKED TO AMONG  REPUBLICANS IN VIRGINIA SAYS THE PROBLEM CUCCINELLI HAS IS HE&#39;S  PERCEIVED AS ARROGANT. HE DOESN&#39;T HAVE THE LIKABILITY  FACTOR WORKING IN HIS FAVOR. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BUT DO YOU THINK CHRIS  CHRISTIE CAN GET OUT OF A  REPUBLICAN PRIMARY NOT HAVING TO SORT OF DOUBLE DOWN ON HIS  AVERSION TO GAY MARRIAGE, HIS  BELIEF IN -- WELL, HIS PRO-LIFE  STANCE? I MEAN, CAN HE --  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, HE&#39;S GOING TO HAVE TO  FIGURE OUT HOW TO TALK ABOUT  THOSE THINGS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HE THUS FAR HASN&#39;T HAD TO. PROFESSOR, I WANT TO ASK YOU A  QUESTION ABOUT MONEY. A FORMER OBAMA CAMPAIGN  OPERATIVE SAID THE DRREMOCRATS ARE REALLY GOING TO REGRET NOT  HAVING PUT UP MORE OF A FIGHT IN NEW JERSEY. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE MONEY  THAT WAS SPENT ON BARBARA BUONO, NO MONEY WAS REALLY SPENT ON  BARBARA BUONO. SHE HAD NO REAL SUPPORT FROM THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS  ASSOCIATION. SHE SAID, THE DEMOCRATIC  POLITICAL BOSSES, SOME ELECTED  AND SOME NOT, MADE A DEAL WITH  THIS GOVERNOR DESPITE HIM  REPRESENTING EVERYTHING THEY&#39;RE  SUPPOSED TO BE AGAINST. DID IT SURPRISE YOU THAT THERE  WAS SO LITTLE RESISTANCE IN NEW  JERSEY FROM THE SIDE OF THE  DEMOCRATS? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; OH, I&#39;M STUNNED BECAUSE, YES, HE WOULD HAVE VERY DIFFICULT TO  DEFEAT, PROBABLY WOULDN&#39;T HAPPEN UNDER ANY CONDITIONS, BUT YOU  ROUGH A GUY LIKE THAT UP. YOU CREATE A RECORD. YOU FORCE HIM TO LOSE HIS  TEMPER. WHY WOULD I SAY HE MIGHT LOSE  HIS TEMPER? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE&#39;S CHRIS CHRISTIE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU CREATE SOME VIDEO THAT  YOU CAN USE WHEN YOU COME TO THE PRESIDENTIAL YEAR. THEY UTTERLY FAILED TO DO IT. I&#39;M JUST MYSTIFIED AS TO WHY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK YOU CAN BLAME CORY  BOOKER FOR THAT. THIS WAS THE RACE HE WAS  SUPPOSED TO RUN. HE PANICKED. I THINK HE WAS AFRAID THAT HE  MIGHT NOT BEAT CHRISTIE, AND HE  WENT FOR THE LOW-HANGING FRUIT  IN THE FORM OF THE SENATE SEAT. YOU KNOW, FORCING LAUTENBERG  INTO RETIREMENT AND WHEN  LAUTENBERG DIED, IT WAS HIS FOR  THE TAKING. I THINK AFTER THAT, PEOPLE HAD  REAL DOUBTS. DEMOCRATS IN NEW JERSEY HAD REAL DOUBTS ABOUT WHETHER BOOKER, WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN THEIR STRONGEST  POSSIBLE CANDIDATE, COULD HAVE  BEAT CHRISTIE. WITHOUT HIM, THEY DIDN&#39;T EVEN  FEEL LIKE RUNNING. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IN A VERY POLITICALLY SHREWD  MOVE, CHRISTIE MADE SURE HE WAS  NOT ON THE SAME BALLOT AS CORY  BOOKER, EVEN IF HE WAS RUNNING  FOR A DIFFERENT SEAT. LAST QUESTION IN TERMS OF MONEY. I MEAN, TERRY McAULIFFE, $32.8  MILLION SPENT ON THAT RACE. KEN CUCCINELLI SPENT $19.1  MILLION. A LOT OF MONEY. CHRIS CHRISTIE IN THE NEW JERSEY ELECTION, THERE WAS TWICE THE  AMOUNT OF MONEY SPENT. A LOT OF IT WAS ON DOWN BALLOT  RACES. I THINK THAT&#39;S EVIDENCE THAT THE STATE LEVEL, THE MUNICIPAL  LEVEL, THIS IS WHERE ALL THE  ACTION IS GOING TO BE IN  AMERICAN POLITICS, AND WE CAN  JUST EXPECT A WAVE OF MONEY IN  THE UPCOMING MIDTERMS AND OF  COURSE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHEN DON&#39;T WE SEE THAT? OF COURSE, IT JUST KEEPS GOING  UP AND UP, AND THERE SEEMS TO BE A WELLSPRING THAT CANNOT BE  LIMITED OF MONEY. YES, I THINK THAT VIRGINIA RACE  DEMONSTRATES THAT. OF COURSE, TERRY McAULIFFE IS A  PROFESSIONAL FUNDRAISER. THAT&#39;S WHAT HE&#39;S DONE ALL OF HIS LIFE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S WHAT TERRY McAULIFFE  DOES, IF NOTHING ELSE. LARRY, THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.","media$content":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":500000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":731.899,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":240,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/tVwmj8HPUlzB?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":420,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":800000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":731.899,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":360,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/Cs81j_LwjFDx?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":640,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":731.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":0,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/whxmvqc0IvlC?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":0,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"media$thumbnails":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"image","plfile$duration":0.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"JPEG","plfile$height":1080,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_wag_2njva_131106.jpg","plfile$width":1920,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"link":"","pubDate":1383765660000,"plmedia$defaultThumbnailUrl":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_wag_2njva_131106.jpg","nnd$associatedPlaylist":{"href":"http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_52794037"},"nnd$brand":"MSNBC","nnd$bureau":"30RockNY","nnd$bviAssetId":"n_wag_2njva_131106","nnd$canonicalUrl":{"href":"http://www.msnbc.com/now-with-alex-wagner/watch/the-power-of-social-issues-in-2013-elections-61736515552"},"nnd$distributionProfile":["MSN-CA"],"nnd$firstAiredAtUtc":1383758188000,"nnd$lastAiredAtUtc":1383758188000,"nnd$lastEditorialChangeAtUtc":1383765720000,"nnd$longTitle":"The power of social issues in 2013 elections","nnd$playCount30":1431,"nnd$playCountDay":995,"nnd$playCountYear":0,"nnd$requiresCaptioning":true,"nnd$shortDescription":"Larry Sabato joins to discuss the two very different approaches Virginia's Ken Cuccinelli and New Jersey Gov.

SEVERAL OF THESE BRAVE MEN AND  WOMEN HAVE JOINED US HERE THIS  AFTERNOON. THEY ARE AMERICAN HEROES WHO  PAID DEARLY FOR BEING TRUE TO  THEMSELVES AS THEY PURSUED THEIR PROFESSIONS. THEY PERFORMED WELL, WERE  REWARDED BY BEING FIRED OR  BRUTALLY BEATEN. FOR THEM, ABILITY DIDN&#39;T COUNT,  BIGOTRY DID. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NEARLY TWO DECADES AFTER  SENATOR TED KENNEDY INTRODUCED  THE EMPLOYMENT NONDISCRIMINATION ACT, CONGRESS HAS STILL NOT  PASSED BASIC PROTECTIONS FOR  GAY, LESBIAN, AND TRANSGENDER  EMPLOYEES. IN LIEU OF A FEDERAL LAW, THIS  IS WHERE AMERICA STANDS. IN 29 STATES, THERE IS NO STATE  LAW PREVENTING AN EMPLOYER FROM  TERMINATING ONE OF ITS WORKERS  SIMPLY BECAUSE HE OR SHE IS GAY. IN 33 STATES, HE OR SHE CAN BE  GIVEN A PINK SLIP FOR NO OTHER  REASON THAN THEY ARE TRANS TRANSGENDER. WHAT&#39;S STANDING IN THE WAY OF  EQUAL RIGHTS FOR ALL? NOT WHAT BUT WHO. SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE JOHN  BOEHNER. WITH SEVEN SENATE REPUBLICANS  SUPPORTING THE VOTE ON MONDAY,  THE UPPER CHAMBER IS POISED TO  APPROVE THE BILL THIS WEEK. BUT SPEAKER BOEHNER HAS ALREADY  INDICATED HE WILL NOT BRING IT  UP FOR A VOTE IN THE HOUSE. HIS REASONING? THE SPEAKER BELIEVES THIS  LEGISLATION WILL INCREASE  FRIVOLOUS LITIGATION AND COST  AMERICAN JOBS. AND YET, THE NONPART SON  GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE FOUND THAT LAST YEAR IN THE 21  STATES WITH LAWS PROTECTING LGBT EMPLOYEES, LAWSUITS THAT  INCLUDED A CLAIM OF  DISCRIMINATION BASED ON SEXUAL  ORIENTATION OR GENDER  IDENTIFICATION WERE LESS THAN 7% OF ALL EMPLOYER DISCRIMINATION  LITIGATION. FACTS BE DAMNED, LEADERS OF THE  GOP MAY CONTINUE TO DIG IN THEIR HEELS, BUT TIME AND JUSTICE  CONTINUE THEIR INEXRABBLE MARCH  FORWARD. IF YOU NEEDED ANYMORE PROOF,  LAWMAKERS YESTERDAY MADE  ILLINOIS THE 15th STATE TO ALLOW SAME-SEX MARRIAGE. GOVERNOR PAT QUINN SAYS HE WILL  SIGN IT AT SOME POINT THIS  MONTH. JOINING US NOW FROM WASHINGTON  IS PRESIDENT OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN CHAD GRIFFIN. I&#39;M GETTING CHOKED UP I&#39;M SO  EMOTIONAL ABOUT THIS ISSUE,  CHAD. THANKS FOR JOINING US, AS  ALWAYS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE,  ALEX. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LET ME ASK YOU, IN TERMS OF  JOHN BOEHNER SHUTTING DOWN THE  POSSIBILITY OF A VOTE IN THE  HOUSE, WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS? ARE YOU INDIGNANT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LOOK, IT IS -- IT&#39;S  UNFORTUNATE, LET ME SAY THAT. IT&#39;S ALSO OUTRAGEOUS AND THE  COMMENTS THAT HIS SPOKESPERSON  HAVE MADE ARE SIMPLY INCORRECT. LOOK, LET&#39;S LOOK AT THE POLITICS OF THIS ISSUE FIRST. THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS  SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION. MORE THAN 70% OF AMERICANS, IT  INCLUDES A MAJORITY OF  REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS AND  DEMOCRATS. IT ALSO INCLUDES A MAJORITY  SUPPORT IN ALL 50 STATES IN THIS COUNTRY. ALEX, THE LOWEST LEVEL OF  SUPPORT IN THIS COUNTRY IS THE  STATE OF MISSISSIPPI, WHERE 63%  OF THE VOTERS IN THE STATE OF  MISSISSIPPI SUPPORT THIS  LEGISLATION. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WOW. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AS IT RELATES TO JOBS, LOOK,  THERE IS A REASON THAT SO MANY  AMERICAN COMPANIES SUPPORT THIS  BILL. IT IS NOT OFTEN THAT YOU SEE  MAJOR, MASSIVE AMERICAN  CORPORATIONS ENDORSING  LEGISLATION. GENERAL ELECTRIC, GENERAL MILLS, APPLE COMPUTERS, COORS BEER. THESE ARE EVERY DAY AMERICAN  BRANDS WHO ARE SUPPORTING THIS  LEGISLATION. LOOK, I THINK THE SPEAKER IS  GOING TO HOPEFULLY LOOK AT THE  FACTS. WE&#39;RE GOING TO WORK WITH EVERY  REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT IN THIS  BUILDING BEHIND ME TO ENSURE  THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THE FACTS  AND THEY SEE WHERE THE PUBLIC IS ON THIS COMMON SENSE  LEGISLATION. AND AT THE END OF THE DAY, HE&#39;S  EITHER GOING TO MOVE FORWARD  WITH A VOTE OR HE&#39;S GOING TO GET LEFT BEHIND AND BE REMEMBERED ON THE WRONG SIDE OF HISTORY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CHAD, I&#39;M GOING TO ASK MY  FRIEND HERE, KATHLEEN PARKER,  WHO ARE AS YOU SAID THE SPEAKER  HAS A CHOICE. THE SPEAKER HAS HAD A LOT OF  CHOICES, CHOICES, OPPORTUNITIES  TO STAND UP AND BE COURAGEOUS,  MOVE THE PARTY FORWARD INTO THE  20th OR 21st CENTURY DEPENDING  ON YOUR MARK ON THESE THINGS. AND HE&#39;S CATEGORICALLY ALMOST  NOT TAKEN UP THOSE OPPORTUNITIES GIVEN TO HIM ON A FAIRLY SILVER  PLATTER. KATHLEEN, ARE YOU IN ANY WAY  OPTIMISTIC THAT JOHN BOEHNER  MIGHT BUCK, I GUESS, WHAT THE  MOST --  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK IT&#39;S DEAD. I&#39;LL GIVE YOU A LITTLE  BACKGROUND I GOT WHILE DOING A  LITTLE BIT OF REPORTING ON THIS. FIRST, LET ME CLARIFY MY ROLE  HERE. I AM MARGARET MEADE, OKAY? I AM REPORTING ON THE BEHAVIORS  OF THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; PLEASE DO. THIS IS NOT AN ENDORSEMENT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I&#39;M NOT A SAMOAN. SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IN  THE SENATE, HATCH WANTED AN  AMENDMENT TO MAKE A PROVISION  FOR RELIGIOUS PURPOSES TO ALLOW  THE CATHOLIC CHURCH TO BE ABLE  TO CONTINUE TO LIVE BY THEIR  TEACHINGS. I DON&#39;T THINK THAT WOULD HAPPEN  ACTUALLY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THERE WOULD BE NOBODY LEFT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ANYWAY, IT WAS EXCLUDED SO  THEY DIDN&#39;T GET THAT. BUT I&#39;M SURE THAT -- I THINK I  CAN SAY WITH SOME CERTAINTY THAT JOHN BOEHNER IS NOT GOING TO  ENTERTAIN IT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CHAD, THERE WAS -- GO AHEAD. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NO, LOOK, THIS PIECE OF  LEGISLATION IS BASED ON THE  CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964. IT INCLUDES RELIGIOUS  EXEMPTIONS. SENATOR PORTMAN WANTED AN  AMENDMENT THAT I BELIEVE JUST  MOMENTS BEFORE I CAME ON HERE  ACTUALLY PASSED. WE FELT IT WAS UNNECESSARY, BUT  IT WENT FORWARD. AND IT PASSED. ALL OF THE TALKING POINTS  AGAINST THIS -- IF YOU LOOK AT  WHAT SPEAKER BOEHNER&#39;S  SPOKESPERSON SAID, THOSE ARE THE TALKING POINTS THAT COME  STRAIGHT FROM THE RIGHT-WING,  ANTI-GAY, HOMOPHOBIC EXTREMISTS. THAT&#39;S NOT THE VIEW OF MOST  REPUBLICANS. MOST OF THE REPUBLICAN  ELECTORATE. AND IT&#39;S NOT THE VIEW OF MOST  REPUBLICANS IN THIS BUILDING  BEHIND ME. I HOPE THE SPEAKER IS GOING TO  REALIZE WE&#39;RE IN A NEW DAY IN  THIS COUNTRY. THIS IS A BASIC AMERICAN VALUE. I THINK INCREASINGLY ELECTED  OFFICIALS, DEMOCRAT AND  REPUBLICAN, ARE GOING TO START  PAYING A PRICE WHEN THEY&#39;RE ON  THE WRONG SIDE OF HISTORY,  ESPECIALLY ON A PIECE OF  LEGISLATION THAT HAS SUCH BROAD  AND WIDE-REACHING SUPPORT IN  THIS COUNTRY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YEAH, I MEAN, ESPECIALLY AS  THE GOP SORT OF PRESUMES OR  TAKES THE MANTLE ON BEING THE  PARTY OF BUSINESS. OF THE FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES,  88% OF THEM PREVENT  DISCRIMINATION AGAINST GAY AND  LESBIAN EMPLOYEES. WE ARE THERE. THIS SORT OF LAST STAND AGAINST  EQUAL RIGHTS DOES NOT SEEM LIKE  SOMETHING THAT WILL SERVE THE  PARTY WELL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU. I IMMEDIATELY E-MAILED SOMEONE  WHEN I HEARD THIS. I SAID, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHY AREN&#39;T YOU THROWING OPEN THE FLAPS OF THAT TENT INSTEAD OF,  YOU KNOW, FINDING A WAY TO  STITCH IT CLOSED? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; DON&#39;T YOU THINK MOST  AMERICANS THINK IT IS ILLEGAL TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST GAY PEOPLE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YES, THEY PROBABLY DO. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THEY&#39;RE SO FAR AHEAD OF  POLITICIANS ON THIS THAT THIS  HAS A CURIOUS EFFECT OF  REMINDING PEOPLE THERE&#39;S NO  LEGAL PROTECTION IN MANY STATES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I ASSUMED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ONE OF OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGES HAS BEEN THAT OVER 80% OF  AMERICANS BELIEVE THAT THIS IS  ALREADY ILLEGAL IN THIS COUNTRY  TODAY. IT&#39;S OUTRAGEOUS TO THINK THAT  ONE COULD BE FIRED SIMPLY  BECAUSE WHO THEY ARE, HOW THEY  WERE BORN, HOW GOD MADE THEM. BUT IN FACT, IT IS, IN THE VAST  MAJORITY OF STATES IN THIS  COUNTRY. IT IS PERFECTLY LEGAL TO BE  FIRED BECAUSE OF WHO YOU ARE OR  NOT TO BE HIRED IN THE FIRST  PLACE. IT&#39;S TIME THAT WE DO SOMETHING  ABOUT IT AND WE DO SOMETHING  NOW. I HOPE SPEAKER BOEHNER WILL  LISTEN TO HIS CONSTITUENTS, WILL LISTEN TO REPUBLICANS, AND WILL  LISTEN TO BUSINESS AND BE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY AND MOVE  THIS LEGISLATION FORWARD. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE HOPE THAT SPEAKER BOEHNER  LISTENS TO SENATORS AYOTTE,  COLLINS, HATCH, HELLER, KIRK,  PORTMAN, AND TOOMEY.

THE DAUGHTER OF CHINESE  IMMIGRANTS, HER BROTHER AND  FATHER DIED FROM BRAIN TUMORS  WITHIN A YEAR OF EACH OTHER WHEN SHE WAS JUST 14 YEARS OLD. WHILE IN HIGH SCHOOL, SHE  LEARNED HER MOTHER HAD BEEN  FORCED TO ABANDON HER FOUR  CHILDREN FROM AN ABUSIVE  MARRIAGE IN SHANGHAI, BEFORE  EMIGRATING TO THE U.S. THOUGH THEY DON&#39;T TACKLE HER  PERSONAL TRAGEDIES HEAD ON, THEY EXPLORE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN  FAMILY HEMEMBERS. HER LATEST BOOK TELLS THE STORY  OF AMERICAN EX-PATHS, A MOTHER  AND DAUGHTER WORKING AS COURT  SANS IN THE EARLY 20th CENTURY  IN SHANGHAI. JOINING US NOW, A BEST-SELLING  AUTHOR, PERSONAL HERO OF MINE,  AMY TAN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IN TERMS OF IDENTITY AND  EXPERIENCE, WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THIS BOOK IS TWO AMERICAN WOMEN  IN CHINA, WHICH IS ALMOST THE  INVERSE OF YOUR EXPERIENCE. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU PERSONALLY ABOUT HOW YOUR OWN HISTORY HERE  IN AMERICA AND YOUR BACKGROUND  IN CHINA INFORMED, YOU KNOW,  SORT OF THE DYNAMICS OF THIS  RELATIONSHIP. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, IT&#39;S MY FAMILY&#39;S PAST  THAT I AM MOST INTERESTED IN  BECAUSE A LOT OF THAT TRAUMA  THAT&#39;S HAPPENED IN MY FAMILY, MY MOTHER&#39;S MARRIAGE, MY  GRANDMOTHER WHO BECAME A  CONCUBINE, HAS MADE ME. I FEEL LIKE IT&#39;S PASSED DOWN. TRAUMA GETS PASSED DOWN  GENERATION TO GENERATION. THEN WE HAVE TRAUMA IN OUR  FAMILY THAT HAS ALSO INFLUENCED  ME. THE OTHER PART OF IT IS BEING  DIFFERENT IN AMERICA. I&#39;M RAISED TO THINK I&#39;M AN  AMERICAN. I HAVE THESE CERTAIN PRIVILEGES. I HAVE MY INGENUITY, I CAN MAKE  MYSELF AND BECOME WHOEVER I  WANT. NOW YOU HAVE AN AMERICAN IN A  BOOK LIKE THAT WHO GOES FROM  THAT PRIVILEGE INTO CHINA, FIND  OUT HER INGENUITY DOES NOT  EMIGRATE WITH HER. SHE&#39;S NOW STUCK WITH TRADITION  AND A SENSE OF FATE. AND I FEEL THAT I AM EXPLORING  THAT, AND I WONDER WHAT PART OF  ME HAS HAD THAT IMPOSED ON ME. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, AND IT&#39;S INTERESTING AS A MOTHER -- AS A DAUGHTER OF A  MOTHER WHO COMES FROM ASIA. THERE&#39;S A SENSE OF LACK OF  NOSTALGIA, I THINK -- OR LACK OF PRONOUNCED NOSTALGIA, AT LEAST  IN MY FAMILY, ABOUT THE  HARDSHIPS ENDURED BACK HOME AND  A SORT OF VERY KIND OF  OPTIMISTIC EMBRACE OF THIS IS  THE NEW PLACE IN WHICH WE ARE  LIVING, WE ARE AMERICANS NOW,  FORGET ABOUT THE PAST. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS YOU DO SO  MASTERFULLY IS YOU SORT OF TALK  ABOUT AND YOU DISCUSS AND YOU  SET THE STAGE FOR THE PAIN AND  THE EMOTIONAL BREAK THAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU LEAVE ONE PLACE AND GO  TO THE NEXT. AND THE FEELINGS THAT ARE VERY  RARELY DISCUSSED, I THINK, IN  ASIAN HOUSEHOLDS ABOUT A SENSE  OF LOSS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT LACK OF  COMMUNICATION IS THE REASON WHY  THERE IS THIS RIFT OFTENTIMES  BETWEEN MOTHERS AND DAUGHTERS,  BUT ESPECIALLY DAUGHTERS --  MOTHERS AN DAUGHTERS OF  DIFFERENT CULTURAL UPBRINGINGS. I DIDN&#39;T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT MY  FAMILY&#39;S PAST. I DIDN&#39;T EVEN KNOW CHINA WAS IN  WORLD WAR II. I DIDN&#39;T KNOW IT STARTED THERE. YOU KNOW, SO ONCE THIS -- IT WAS LIKE OPENING A DOOR TO A  COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WORLD. JUST LIKE IF YOU LOOK UNDER AND  LOOK AT THE OCEAN, YOU REALIZE  THERE&#39;S THIS OTHER WORLD DOWN  THERE. THIS PAST THAT I COULD STEP INTO AND SEE WHAT HAD BEEN SHAPING MY LIFE ALL ALONG. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WAS IT -- I MEAN, IT IS A  FAIRLY DRAMATIC AND SEEMINGLY  TRAUMATIC FAMILY HISTORY THAT  YOU HAVE. AND YOU HAVE BEEN REMARK -- YOU  SEEM REMARKABLY -- WE&#39;RE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT IT, BUT ALSO -- I  GUESS I WOULD ASK YOU, THE WAY  THAT YOU CAN WRITE ABOUT  TRAGEDY, I MEAN, MUST BE  INFORMED BY YOUR OWN RESILIENCE  WITH YOUR OWN HISTORY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YEAH, YOU KNOW, THERE&#39;S A  TRAGEDY WITH MY GRANDMOTHER. SHE WAS KNOWN AS THIS VERY  TRADITIONAL, OLD-FASHIONED WOMAN WHO WAS QUIET AND SHE&#39;D BEEN  WIDOW WHEN IS HER HUSBAND DIED  DURING THE PANDEMIC. THAT&#39;S WHAT I ALWAYS THOUGHT,  THAT THERE WAS A TRAGEDY THERE,  A VICTIM. AND THEN SHE WAS RAPED AND  FORCED TO BECOME A CONCUBINE. BUT I HEARD LATER ON A DIFFERENT STORY ABOUT HER HAVING BEEN  POSSIBLY -- WELL, THROUGH A  PHOTOGRAPH LOOKING AT THIS AND  REALIZING SHE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN  THE WOMAN I THOUGHT. AND HER HISTORY IS STILL  IMPORTANT TO ME, AND I WANTED TO KNOW, OKAY, IF MY GRANDMOTHER  HAD BEEN THIS OTHER PERSON AND  THE OTHER PERSON BEING A COURT  SAN, HOW HAS THAT SHAPED WHO I  AM, YOU KNOW? WHAT DO I KNOW NOW ABOUT MYSELF, MY ATTITUDES TOWARDS LIFE? WHY ARE THE WOMEN IN MY FAMILY  SO STRONG? WHAT ADVERSITY DID WE HAVE TO  OVERCOME? YOU KNOW, IT&#39;S THOSE PUZZLES  WHEN YOU GO BACK AND YOU LOOK AT THEM, AND THEY WERE TRAUMAS. THEY&#39;RE STILL TRAUMAS, BUT YOU  WONDER WHAT ELSE IS THERE, THESE MYSTERIES. I&#39;LL NEVER KNOW FOR SURE. YOU KNOW, ALL OF THE HISTORY OF  MY FAMILY. BUT THERE IS A BIG ONE THAT JUST GOT UNLEASHED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT IS A REASON FOR ALL OF US  TO GO BACK AND PLUM THE DEPTHS  OF OUR FAMILY TREE, ALTHOUGH I  DON&#39;T KNOW WE COME UP WITH  ANYTHING REMOTELY AS INTERESTING OR LYRICAL OR COMPELLING. AMY TAN. THE BOOK IS &quot;THE VALLEY OF  AMAZEMENT.&quot; THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING  US.

TUESDAY NOVEMBER 5th AND THIS IS &quot;NOW.&quot; ELECTION DAY 2013 AS VOTERS HEAD TO THE POLLS IN CITIES AND  STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY FROM  THE DEEP SOUTH TO THE NORTHEAST  AND MIDDLE WEST, THERE COULD BE  VERY REAL IMPLICATIONS FOR THE  FUTURE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY  AND FOUNDATIONS OF THE  DEMOCRATIC PLATFORM. IN THE BLUE STATE OF NEW JERSEY, REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR CHRIS  CHRISTIE IS EXPECTED TO WIN  RE-ELECTION BY A LANDSLIDE  AGAINST DEMOCRATIC STATE SENATOR AND LIKELY WITH THE SUPPORT OF  WOMEN AND AFRICAN-AMERICANS. BUT IF CHRISTIE TODAY FINDS  HIMSELF IN THE CONDUCTOR SEAT OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, A ROWDY  TEA PARTY IS STILL IN THE  CABOOSE. IN VIRGINIA GUBERNATORIAL RACE  BETWEEN DEMOCRAT TERRY McAULIFFE AND REPUBLICAN KEN CUCCINELLI IS SHAPING UP TO BE A DEMOCRATIC  VICTORY. MAINLY BECAUSE CUCCINELLI&#39;S  BRAND OF ULTRACONSERVATIVE  POLITICS HAS NOT SOLD. QUINNIPIAC POLL SHOWED McAULIFFE AHEAD OF CUCCINELLI BY SIX  POINTS. IF THEY SHOW UP, THE NEXT  GOVERNOR COULD BE A DEMOCRAT. IF HE WINS, THE LONG ETHANK YOU  LETTER WILL BE TO THE WOMEN OF  THE OLD DOMINION. CUCCINELLI FACES A GAP SO  ENORMOUS IT IS BETTER DESCRIBED  AS A YAWNING CHASM. WOMEN CHOOSING THE DEMOCRATIC  CANDIDATE BY A MARGIN OF 50 TO  36. AS IT TURNS OUT LADIES AREN&#39;T  ALL THAT INTO ANTI-ABORTION,  ANTI-SOD MY. THINKING PEOPLE. JOINING ME MICHAEL STEELE. NBC POLITICAL ANALYST AND FORMER GOVERNOR ED RENDELL. MANAGING EDITOR OF THE GRIO.COM  JOY REID AND DEPUTY OF NEW YORK  CITY HOWARD WILSON. MY FELLOWS AND FRIENDS, THANK  YOU FOR JOINING ME ON THIS  ELECTION DAY, WHICH I&#39;M  DETERMINED TO MAKE A BIG DEAL IN THIS HOUR WE HAVE. MICHAEL STEELE, I&#39;LL GO TO YOU  FIRST. TALK ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF  THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. I WANT TO START WITH VIRGINIA. MY QUESTION TO YOU IS WILL THE  GOP TAKE NOTICE IF KEN  CUCCINELLI IS DEFEATED.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THEY WILL TAKE NOTICE OF IT. IN A SENSE WE&#39;RE MAKING MORE OF  THESE TWO ELECTIONS IN TERMS OF  WHERE THE GOP IS GOING TO BE AND NATION IS GOING TO BE IN TWO OR  THREE YEARS. WHAT&#39;S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND  IS AFFECTED BY DIFFERENT THINGS, NOT JUST CUCCINELLI&#39;S RECORD  WITH WOMEN, THE IMPACT OF  GOVERNOR McDONNELL ON THE RACE  WAS SIGNIFICANT. THE IMPACT OF WHAT REPUBLICANS  DID NATIONALLY TO SHUT DOWN THE  GOVERNMENT WAS SIGNIFICANT. SO WOMEN 50 TO 36 FOR HIS  OPPONENT ARE NOT NECESSARILY  THERE BECAUSE OF HOT BUTTON  AGENDA ITEMS. IT&#39;S A COMPLETE PACKAGE OF  ISSUES.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; A COMPLETE PACKAGE OF  DISAST DISASTER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt;.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOT JUST SOCIAL ENGINE  DRIVING THIS TRAIN. THERE&#39;S A BIG ECONOMIC ENGINE AS WELL AS WE SAW WITH THE  GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. I THINK PEOPLE NEED TO PUT SOME  OF THIS IN CONTEXT AND NOT START EXTRAPOLATING, PARTICULARLY NEW  JERSEY, TALK ABOUT THAT LATER,  IN TERMS OF WHAT THIS REALLY  MEANS AND THE SYMBOLISM AND  MESSAGE GOING FORWARD.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NUMBERS WISE, THAT MARGIN, 24 POINTS IN SOME POLLS. WOMEN VOTERS CHOOSING TERRY  McAULIFFE. THE LANGUAGE HAS HAD ITS EFFECT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IF YOU JUST WANT TO TALK  ABOUT THE BROADER ISSUES, IF YOU COULD TAKE FAR RIGHT  CONSERVATISM AND PUT IT IN A  PETRI DISH, YOU WOULD GET  GOVERNOR&#39;S RACE IN VIRGINIA. EVERY ISSUE IN ONE RACE,  GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN, WOMEN,  EVANGELICAL ISSUES. IT&#39;S THE FAR RIGHT HAS THEIR  IDEAL TICKET. THIS IS WHAT THE BASE OF THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY SAYS SHOULD BE  WINNING ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN  EVERY WAY. TEA PARTYISM, SHUTDOWN, WOMEN&#39;S  ISSUES, BANNING CONTRACEPTION. IT&#39;S THERE AND IT&#39;S GOING TO  LOSE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE PARTY I THINK NEEDS TO  TAKE RECOGNITION OF MORE THAN  ANYTHING ELSE IS HOW THESE  THINGS ARE CHANGING. VIRGINIA WAS A RELIABLY RED  STATE FOR A LONG TIME. IT HAS NOW TRANSITIONED TO  PURPLE AND MAYBE ON ITS WAY TO  BLUE, WE&#39;LL SEE. BUT THE PARTY HAS NOT KEPT UP  WHERE THE VOTERS ARE MOVING. THAT&#39;S ALSO THE BIG PROBLEM IN  STATES LIKE VIRGINIA AS WE SAW  IN NORTH CAROLINA AS WELL AND  OTHER SOUTHERN STATES. THAT TREND LINE IS SOMETHING  THEY REALLY NEED TO PAY  ATTENTION TO.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I WANT TO BRING IN OUR  ELECTIONS EXPERT, IF YOU WILL,  WHO IS HOUSED IN CAMBRIDGE,  MASSACHUSETTS RIGHT NOW. SASHA EISENBERG, AUTHOR OF &quot;THE  SECRET SCIENCE OF WINNING  CAMPAIGNS&quot; WHICH THANKFULLY IS  OUT IN PAPER BACK. IT&#39;S GREAT TO SEE YOU, MY  FRIEND. I THINK THE LAST TIME WE TALKED  WAS IN THE WAKE OF THE 2012  ELECTION. I WOERND GIVEN THE WORK YOU DID  AND REPORTING YOU DID IN THAT  ELECTION CYCLE WHETHER YOU THINK ANY LESSONS HAVE BEEN LEARNED ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE AISLE IN  TERMS OF VOTER OUTRAGE? CAN WE SEE ANY LESSONS IN  VIRGINIA? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I&#39;VE BEEN REALLY SURPRISED. THERE&#39;S BEEN A LOT OF LIP  SERVICE ON THE RIGHT STARTING  WITH RNC POSTMORTEM REPORT THAT  CAME OUT THIS YEAR, TALKING  ABOUT THE NEED TO MAKE BETTER  INVESTMENTS AND THE GROUND GAME, THE USE OF DATA AND ANALYTICS. I DON&#39;T IN TALKING TO  REPUBLICANS AT THE NATIONAL OR  LOCAL LEVEL SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE  WHO HAVE DEVELOPED THE EXPERTISE TO DO THAT. THIS IS DIFFICULT, SOPHISTICATED STUFF. YOUR NORMAL SORT OF POLITICAL  OPERATIVE STAFFER TYPES DON&#39;T  HAVE THE SKILL SET TO DO IT. IN THE WAKE OF THE DEMOCRAT&#39;S  LOSS IN 2004, THEY INVEST IN A  LOT OF NEW INSTITUTIONS TO HOUSE DATA, DO ANALYSIS, DO TESTING AT GREAT COSTS THAT EXISTED ON THE  LEFT. NOBODY ON THE RIGHT HAS TAKEN  THAT TYPE OF LEAP YET.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IN TERMS OF THE CAMPAIGN  ITSELF, GOVERNOR, THE SURROGATE  ISSUE IN VIRGINIA WAS -- HAS  BEEN AN INTERESTING ONE. TERRY McAULIFFE HAS HAD THE  ASSISTANCE OF BILL AND HILLARY  CLINTON. HE THE VICE PRESIDENT AND  PRESIDENT STUMPING FOR HIM. CUCCINELLI HAS HAD MARCO RUBIO,  RON PAUL, RICK SANTORUM AND THE  DUGGERS. YOU TALK ABOUT A DEARTH OF  LEADERSHIP AND EFFECTIVE  EMISSA EMISSARIES, THIS WOULD AB CASE  STUDY. &quot;POLITICO&quot; STRIKING CONTRAST IN  SURROGATES IN THE HOMESTRETCH OF VIRGINIA GOVERNOR&#39;S RACE ANOTHER REMINDER GOP&#39;S LARGER LEADERSHIP VACUUM AND CIVIL WAR FOR THE  SOUL OF THE PARTY REELING FROM  LAST YEAR&#39;S THRASHING. SIMPLY PUT, LACKS A UNIFYING  FIGURE THAT APPEALS TO EVERY  PART LET ALONE MATCHES THE  CLINTON-OBAMA.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THEY CAN DO ALL THE MARKETING THEY WANT, ALL THE OUTREACH THEY WANT. IF THEY DON&#39;T CHANGE THEIR BASIC SUBSTANTIVE POSITION ON WOMEN&#39;S  ISSUE. IF THEY DON&#39;T CHANGE THE  LANGUAGE, LANGUAGE WE&#39;VE SEEN  RECENTLY ABOUT  AFRICAN-AMERICANS, IF THEY DON&#39;T STOP SHOWING UP WITH A  CONFEDERATE FLAG, THEY CAN HAVE  10,000 OUTREACH PEOPLE IN THE  AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY,  WOMEN&#39;S COMMUNITY, IT WON&#39;T MAKE A DIFFERENCE. PEOPLE AREN&#39;T DUMB. THEY KNOW WHO THEIR FRIENDS ARE  AND WHO THEY AREN&#39;T. THAT&#39;S NUMBER ONE. IN TERMS OF SURROGATES, I WOULD  CONTEND GOP HAS SURROGATES WHO  DO APPEAL TO 90% OF THE  ELECTORATE BUT WEREN&#39;T IN  VIRGINIA. WHERE WAS JEB BUSH. DID JEB BUSH GO TO VIRGINIA? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NO.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; JEB BUSH HAS BROAD APPEAL. HE HAS BROAD APPEAL IN  PENNSYLVANIA. THAT DOESN&#39;T MEAN HE WOULD CARRY IF HE WERE THE PRESIDENTIAL  CANDIDATE BUT HE HAS BROAD  APPEAL. THOSE REPUBLICANS DIDN&#39;T SHOW  UP. CHRIS CHRISTIE DIDN&#39;T LEAVE THE  STATE TO CAMPAIGN FOR KEN  CUCCINELLI.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NO. AND WOULD HE HAVE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU&#39;VE GOT A GROUP OF  REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS WHO ARE  SOCIAL CONSERVATIVES BUT THEY  DON&#39;T EMPHASIZE. CUCCINELLI MADE THAT THE HEART  AND SOUL OF HIS CAMPAIGN. WHEN SCOTT WALKER AND RICK  SNYDER AND JOHN KASICH RUNS FOR  RE-ELECTION, THEY ARE NOT GOING  TO BE TALKING ABOUT SOCIAL  ISSUES.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HOWARD, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE Mac. IF THINGS GO THAT WAY, TERRY  McAULIFFE IS GOING TO BE  GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA. I JUST SAID THAT. A SEASONED DEMOCRATIC OPERATIVE  AND CAMPAIGN GENIUS, WHAT DO YOU THINK THE IMPLICATIONS ARE FOR  THAT IN 2016 AND ALSO WHAT KIND  OF JOB IS TERRY McAULIFFE GOING  TO DO AS GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK HE&#39;S GOING TO DO A  VERY GOOD JOB. I&#39;VE KNOWN TERRY FOR A LONG TIME THROUGH THE CLINTONS. HAS HE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF  ENERGY, A GOOD SALESPERSON FOR  THAT STATE. HE&#39;S SOMEBODY THAT CAN WORK WITH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS. ONE THING THEY ARE LOOKING FOR  IS SOMEBODY THAT CAN GO ACROSS  PARTY LINES AND WORK WITH  SOMEBODY TO GET SOMETHING DONE. THE CURRENT GOVERNOR IN VIRGINIA HAD THAT REPUTATION. HE LOST SOME OF HIS LUSTER  BECAUSE OF THE SCANDALS. CUCCINELLI WAS SO FAR TO THE  RIGHT ON TRANSPORTATION ISSUES,  OTHER ISSUES WHERE DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS CAME TOGETHER THAT  McAULIFFE SEEMED LIKE THE  BIPARTISAN MODERATE. HERE IS A GUY FORMER HEAD OF THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE  RUNNING AS THE BIPARTISAN  MODERATE AND WAS IN COMPARISON  TO KEN CUCCINELLI. CHRIS CHRISTIE FOR ALL HIS  BLUSTER AND TALK HAS A DESERVED  REPUTATION AS SOMEBODY WHO CAN  REACH ACROSS PARTY LINES AND GET THINGS DONE WITH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS. PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AS WASHINGTON SHUTS DOWN AND DOESN&#39;T WORK,  THEY ARE LOOKING FOR PEOPLE WHO  CAN GET THINGS DONE, REACH  ACROSS PARTY LINES AND DO THAT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LIVE IN VIRGINIA, NBC CAPITOL HILL CORRESPONDENT LUKE RUSSERT. ARE YOU THERE? THERE YOU ARE. ALWAYS GREAT TO SEE YOU, MY  FRIEND, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU&#39;RE  WHERE ALL THE ACTION IS. I GUESS MY FIRST QUESTION IS  WHAT&#39;S THE MOOD ON THE GROUND  OVER THERE? THIS IS A -- FAVORS TERRY  McAULIFFE BY SIX POINTS. IF TURNOUT ISN&#39;T AS THEY HOPE IT WOULD BE, IT COULD GO KEN  CUCCINELLI&#39;S DIRECTION. WHAT ARE YOU SEEING? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S THE NAME OF THE GAME,  ALEX. IT&#39;S ALL ABOUT TURNOUT. I&#39;M AT LOVELY LANGLEY HIGH  SCHOOL, McLANE, VIRGINIA, A  LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN WILSON  HIGH SCHOOL WHERE YOU ATTENDED.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CONTINUE ON.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH YOU ARE  RIGHT. THIS IS A TURNOUT ELECTION FOR  TERRY McAULIFFE. HE NEEDS HIGH TURNOUT IN AREAS  RICHMOND, NORFOLK, KIND OF THAT  HAMPTONS ROAD AREA. THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN IS VERY  MUCH IN THE BACK OF PEOPLE&#39;S  MIND ESPECIALLY AROUND WELSCH  D.C. THAT CARD IS ONE McAULIFFE HAS  BEEN PLAYING A LOT. IN TERMS OF TURNOUT WE&#39;RE AROUND THE 20% MARK. THE LATEST NUMBERS IN THIS  PRECINCT OVER 1200 PEOPLE VOTED  AT 6:00 A.M. THAT&#39;S ON PAR WITH  WHAT A NORMAL VIRGINIA  GOVERNOR&#39;S RACE ELECTION IS AND  McAULIFFE PEOPLE WANTED TO GET  THAT UP HIGHER. WHERE WE STAND RIGHT NOW,  OBVIOUSLY THE POLLING WAS GOING  IN McAULIFFE&#39;S DIRECTION. SO FAR THE TURNOUT WOULD SEEM TO SUGGEST CUCCINELLI HAS A CHANCE  AS WE GET FORWARD INTO THE DAY. IN TERMS OF TALKING TO VOTERS,  MOST I TALKED TO ARE NOT  SURPRISED, ON THE McAULIFFE  SIDE. MOST REITERATED THIS POINT ON  MORE THAN ONE OCCASION. I WAS A REPUBLICAN. I SUPPORTED GEORGE W. BUSH. THE PARTY WENT AWAY FROM ME. IT&#39;S BEEN INTERESTING TO HEAR  THIS FROM THE VOTERS. IF YOU LOOK AROUND THE AREA,  THESE ARE HIGH WEALTH AREAS. THEY WANT TAX CUTS FOR THE MOST  PART BUT THEY HAVE BEEN PUT OFF  FROM THE DIRECTION THE PARTY IS  GOING FROM THE CONVERSATIONS I  HAD HERE. FASCINATING TO SEE WHAT THE  TURNOUT OPERATION DOES AROUND  THE HOUSE. RIGHT NOW SLOW AND STEADY IN  NORTHERN VIRGINIA. I&#39;M SURE McAULIFFE WOULD LIKE  THAT PICKED UP A LITTLE BIT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SASHA, IN TERMS OF TURNOUTS,  TRADITIONALLY WE THINK OF  REPUBLICANS AS HAVING MUCH  BETTER OPERATION IN TERMS OF  TURNING OUT VOTERS IN OFF YEAR  ELECTIONS. DO YOU THINK THAT DEMOCRATS ARE  LEARNING THE LESSON OF HOW TO  GET VOTERS TO THE POLLS WHEN THE STATES ARE NOT SEEN NATIONALLY  AS THAT HIGH BUT ULTIMATELY ARE  QUITE HIGH FOR A PARTY -- FOR A  POLITICAL LANDSCAPE THAT SEES  MOST ACTION HAPPENING AT THE  STATE LEVEL? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YEAH. ARGUABLY THE BIGGEST SHIFT  THAT&#39;S TAKEN PLACE INNOVATION IN THE WORLD OF CAMPAIGNING HAS  COME IN TERMS OF MOBILIZING  VOTERS, TURNS THEM OUT, NOT JUST PERSUADING THEM. CAMPAIGNS ESPECIALLY ON THE LEFT HAVE GOTTEN SMARTER ABOUT  UNDERSTANDING BEHAVIORAL  PSYCHOLOGY OF MOTIVATING VOTERS. WHAT&#39;S COME AWAY, OBVIOUS WE  HAVE CONVERSATIONS AND TALK  ABOUT WILL DEMOCRATS BE  MOTIVATED TO TURN OUT,  ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THEIR  CANDIDATES. ALL OF THAT HAS SOME IDEA VOTERS ARE SELF-DRIVEN. WE NOW HAVE A LOT OF SCIENCE,  HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF  RANDOMIZED FIELD EXPERIMENTS  THAT SHOWED THERE ARE THINGS  CAMPAIGNS CAN DO TO MAKE  NONVOTERS VOTE. THEY ARE OFTEN VERY SIMPLE SORT  OF BEHAVIORAL PSYCHOLOGY  INTERVENTIONS THAT HAVE NOTHING  TO DO WITH THE CANDIDATES OR  ISSUES. DEMOCRATS HAVE MASTERED THOSE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CAN YOU GIVE US AN EXAMPLE? WHAT&#39;S AN EXAMPLE OF THAT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF VIRGINIA  HAS PUT STICKERS ON VOTERS DOORS IN THE RUN-UP, WE SEE FROM  PUBLIC RECORDS YOU VOTED IN THE  2012 ELECTION. ANOTHER ELECTION IS COMING UP. WE KNOW FROM THE PSYCHOLOGICAL  LITERATURE THAT LETTING PEOPLE  KNOW THAT WHAT THEY THOUGHT  MIGHT HAVE BEEN A PRIVATE ACT  WHETHER OR NOT THEY VOTE IS  ACTUALLY A MATTER OF PUBLIC  RECORD. SKO PSYCHOLOGISTS CALL IT SOCIAL  PRESSURE. IT&#39;S REMARKABLY EFFECTIVE  GETTING PEOPLE TO VOTE. IF YOU HAVE GOOD DATA AND STRONG ANALYTICS TELLING YOU WHO  SUPPORTERS ARE IN THE ELECTORATE BUT NOT NECESSARILY HABITUAL  VOTERS AND A LOT OF VOLUNTEERS  WHO CAN PUT STICKERS ON DOORS,  YOU HAVE A RECIPE FOR DRIVING  TURNOUT EVEN IF YOU HAVE TERRY  McAULIFFE WHO YOU WOULD NOT  THINK IS AN INSPIRING FIGURE FOR HIS BASE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WEARING AN &quot;I VOTED&quot; STICKER. GOVERNOR, YOU WANTED TO SAY  SOMETHING THERE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK SASHA IS RIGHT  CAMPAIGNS ESPECIALLY ON THE  DEMOCRATIC SIDE HAVE BECOME MORE SOPHISTICATED AND THAT PUBLIC  PRESSURE ABOUT DID YOU VOTE YET  WORKS TO A DEGREE. BUT DON&#39;T THINK FOR A MOMENT  THAT THERE ISN&#39;T SELF-DRIVEN  VOTERS. THE ENTHUSIASM GAP STILL  MATTERS. IF YOU LOOK AT 2008 WHEN  DEMOCRATIC ENTHUSIASM FOR  PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS AT ITS  HIGHEST LEVEL, UNBELIEVABLE THE  TURNOUT. IN 2010, THE ENTHUSIASM LEVEL  AMONG DEMOCRATIC VOTERS WAS WAY  DOWN. WAY DOWN. ALL THE GOOD TECHNIQUES IN THE  WORLD COULDN&#39;T PRODUCE A GOOD  TURNOUT. THE INTERESTING THING IS IN  PENNSYLVANIA, WE CAME FAIRLY  CLOSE EVEN IN ELECTING SUSTEK  OVER TOOMER. PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID THIS IS  ABOUT ME. ENTHUSIASM CAN&#39;T REPLACE  ANALYTICS. YOU HAVE TO HAVE BOTH.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THERE&#39;S ALSO THE FUNCTION OF  MIDTERM VOTING AND MINORITY AND  YOUNGER VOTERS BEING HABITUALLY  NOT VOTERS. NOT EVEN JUST ENTHUSIASM, IT&#39;S  THE HABIT OF IT. YOU HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO SEE IT AS PRESIDENTIAL ONLY. DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN WORKING ON  THIS. IT WAS A LONG PROJECT. IT WAS DISASTROUS IN 2010 ACROSS THE BOARD DIMINUTION OF VOTE. OBAMA VOTERS DIDN&#39;T SEE OBAMA AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET. SECOND OF ALL, NOT VOTING IN  MIDTERMS. THAT&#39;S THE BIGGEST THING  DEMOCRATS HAVE TO SOLVE GOING  FORWARD BECAUSE IT WAS A CENSUS  YEAR.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; PROBLEM IN 2010 GETTING MY  VOTE TURNED OUT. I DON&#39;T KNOW WHAT YOU&#39;RE TALKING ABOUT. AT THE END OF THE DAY MY VOTE  SHOWED UP.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I LIKE HOW MICHAEL STEELE IS  LIKE I WON, Y&#39;ALL DIDN&#39;T. LUKE, BEFORE WE LET YOU GO,  STANDING AS YOU ARE IN THE PLACE YOU&#39;RE MOST COMFORTABLE, A HIGH  SCHOOL CAFETERIA -- I&#39;M SORRY. I LOVE YOU. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ALEX, ALEX, I ATE AT A  REFECTORY, NOT CAFETERIA.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; TERRY McAULIFFE, THE REST OF  THE RACES IN VIRGINIA -- THE  REST OF THE SEATS IN VIRGINIA,  ATTORNEY GENERAL SEAT AND I  BELIEVE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR  SEATS COULD ALSO GO DEMOCRAT. E.W. JACKSON, WHO IS THE  REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR  LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR -- A TALE OF EUPHEMISMS TODAY. HE&#39;S A WILD MAN. IT SOUNDS LIKE IF McAULIFFE  TAKES THE GOVERNOR&#39;S SEAT E.W.  JACKSON WILL NOT BE ELECTED  LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, WHICH I  THINK IS A SIGH OF RELIEF FOR  MANY AMERICANS WHO HAVE BEEN  LISTENING TO E.W. JACKSON OVER  THE COURSE OF THE LAST SIX  WEEKS. ARE YOU HEARING ANYTHING ABOUT  THOSE RACES? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; JACKSON, THE GUY YOU  MENTIONED HAD THE FAMOUS WRITING THAT YOGA COULD BE SATANIC. I WILL TELL YOU TREE POSE IS THE DEVIL BUT I DON&#39;T KNOW IF YOGA  ITSELF IS SATANIC, ALEX. IT&#39;S SOMETHING DEMOCRATS ARE  EXCITED ABOUT IN VIRGINIA, THE  FACT THEY COULD SWEEP ALL THREE  RACES AND TURN THE STATE FROM  PURPLE ALL THE WAY TO BLUE. WHAT&#39;S INTERESTING, THE  GOVERNOR&#39;S RACE A LOT OF  REPUBLICANS HAVE THROWN IN THE  TOWEL. A LOT HAVE THROWN IN THE TO YOU  TOWEL IN THE LIEUTENANT  GOVERNOR&#39;S RACE. ATTORNEY GENERAL, REPUBLICANS  CAN COMPETE, FASCINATING, LOCAL  ATTORNEY GENERAL&#39;S RACE,  REFERENDUM ON NATIONAL ISSUES. DEMOCRATS GOING AFTER THIS GUY  FOR SEEING HE WAS EXTREMIST  ZEALOT ON WOMEN&#39;S RIGHTS. WOMEN&#39;S RIGHTS IS THE THING YOU  HERE OVER AND OVER AGAIN. REPUBLICANS ATTACKING ATTORNEY  GENERALS RACE, TELLING THE  DEMOCRAT HE WOULD BE A TAX AND  SPEND LIBERAL, YOU DON&#39;T KNOW  WHERE HE STANDS ON SOCIAL  ISSUES. INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS. IF DEMOCRATS SWEEP ALL THREE, A  HUGE ISSUE. TWO OTHER THINGS TO TAKE A LOOK  AT. WHAT ROLE DOES A LIBERTARIAN  PLAY? IF HE&#39;S AROUND 10% HURTS  CUCCINELLI. LAST FACTOIDF McAULIFFE PULLS  THIS OFF, WHICH INDICATIONS ARE  HE WOULD, HE WILL BE THE FOURTH  GOVERNOR IN A ROW OF VIRGINIA TO HAVE NOT BEEN BORN IN THE STATE  AND COME ABOVE THE MASON DIXON  LINE. WE&#39;RE A LONG WAY FROM OLD  VIRGINIA, MY FRIEND, A LONG,  LONG WAY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I LOVE WHEN YOU END SEGMENTS  LIKE THAT. MY FRIEND LUKE RUSSERT, THANK  YOU FOR PUTTING UP WITH ME AND  THANK YOU FOR YOUR REPORTING.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; TAKE IT EASY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt;&gt; DESPITE CRITICISM OF POST  SANDY EMBRACE WITH PRESIDENT  OBAMA, CHRIS CHRISTIE HAS  REMAINED AHEAD IN THE NEW JERSEY GUBERNATORIAL ROLES. DON&#39;T LET HIS MODERATE PROFILE  MISLEAD YOU. CHRIS CHRISTIE IS A CLASSIC  CONSERVATIVE.

DON&#39;T TELL ANYBODY, I&#39;M VOTING  FOR YOU.&quot; RIGHT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR CHRIS  CHRISTIE MAY HAVE ROPED IN  DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT FOR HIS  RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN AND HE MAY  HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BEAT HIS  OPPONENT IN A DEEP BLUE STATE  BUT A DEMOCRAT CHRIS CHRISTIE IS NOT. NATE COAN WRITES IN THE NEW  REPUBLIC. HE CHECKS THE CRUCIAL BOX OF THE RELIGIOUS WINGS OF THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY, PRO-LIFE AND  AGAINST GAY MARRIAGE. HE HAS SOLID CREDENTIALS  OPPOSING TAXES AND ATTACKING  UNIONS WHICH WILL EVENTUALLY  COMPLIMENT CONFORMIST DOMESTIC  POLICY AGENDA. CHRISTIE MAY SOUND LIKE A  MODERATE BUT WHEN IT COMES TO  WALKING THE WALK, THINGS ARE  TRICKIER. YOU BROUGHT UP CHRISTIE AND SAID HE&#39;S ONE OF THOSE FOLKS WHO CAN  WORK ACROSS THE AISLE, PART OF A FUNCTIONING GOVERNMENT, WHICH IS A BIG DEAL THESE DAYS. BUT A DEEPER DIVE INTO HIS  ACTUAL POLICIES, SOMEONE WHO  VETOED THE BILL TO INCREASE  MINIMUM WAGE, DOESN&#39;T SUPPORT  MARRIAGE EQUALITY, IN TERMS OF  INFRASTRUCTURE, AFFORDABLE  HOUSING, CLEAN ENERGY HE&#39;S NOT A SUPPORTER OF THOSE THINGS. I WONDER WHAT YOU THINK AS HIS  NATIONAL PROFILE GROWS. DOES THERE COME A DAY GREATER  RESISTANCE ON THE LEFT SIDE OF  THE AISLE FOR WHAT HE&#39;S DONE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HE&#39;S NOT A DEMOCRAT AND  PROGRESSIVE. A DEMOCRAT AND PROGRESSIVE  WOULDN&#39;T GET THROUGH --  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HE&#39;S A SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HE&#39;S PRO-LIFE AND HE IS  AGAINST SAME-SEX MARRIAGE BUT AS THE GOVERNOR SAID HE&#39;S NOT  PUSHING THOSE ISSUES  AGGRESSIVELY. IN A LOT OF WAYS HE REMINDS ME  OF GEORGE BUSH PRE-2000. PEOPLE FORGET BECAUSE GEORGE  BUSH LEFT OFFICE IN A DIFFERENT  WAY HE WENT IN THAT HE HAD THIS  BIG VICTORY IN TEXAS IN 2008  WHERE HE WORKED ACROSS THE AISLE WITH DEMOCRATS, GO A LOT OF  DEMOCRATS TO VOTE FOR HIM. IN 2000 HE RAN AT A  COMPASSIONATE CONSERVATIVE. HE WAS SELF-CONSCIOUSLY AND  EXPLICITLY PUSHING OFF THE  REPUBLICAN BRAND AND REPUBLICAN  WING OF THE CONGRESSIONAL  REPUBLICAN PARTY. HE AT ONE POINT DURING THE 2000  CAMPAIGN HE CRITICIZED TOM  DELAY, SAID REPUBLICANS IN  CONGRESS WERE TOO MEAN-SPIRITED  AROUND CUTS TO EDUCATION AND  HEALTH CARE. CHRIS CHRISTIE HAS THE SAME  OPPORTUNITY IN SOME RESPECTS. THE CONTRAST BETWEEN WHAT HE&#39;S  DOING IN NEW JERSEY AND WHAT  CUCCINELLI IS GOING TO DO IN  VIRGINIA TODAY IS SO OBVIOUS. ONE PATH IS EXTREME CONSERVATISM WHERE THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE  EMPHASIZES THESE ISSUES AND GOES DOWN TO SPECTACULAR DEFEAT IN A  PURPLE STATE AND THE OTHER IS  SOMEONE WHO IS PRO-LIFE. CHECKS THE BOXES FOR THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY ON THOSE ISSUES BUT DOESN&#39;T EMPHASIZE THEM AND  IS GOING TO WIN A SPECTACULAR  VICTORY IN A BLUE STATE. THIS IS A MODEL HAS THAT WORKED  FOR REPUBLICANS AT THE NATIONAL  LEVEL. THE LAST REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT  WAS ELECTED WITH SUCH A MODEL.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SEEMS LIKE FAIRLY OBVIOUS  LOGIC, MICHAEL STEELE. YOU&#39;RE SHAKING YOUR HEAD ALT  BIT. I WOULD ASK YOU TO WHAT DEGREE  DOES A STRONG CHRIS CHRISTIE  ELECTION FUEL THE TEA PARTY  FIRE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT DOESN&#39;T. THERE IS A PERCEPTION GAP WITH  CHRIS CHRISTIE WITHIN THE PARTY  ITSELF AS TO WHETHER OR NOT HE  IS A, QUOTE, TRUE CONSERVATIVE,  WHICH I THINK IS ONE OF THE  CRAZIEST THOUGHTS IN THE WORLD. THERE&#39;S NO DEGREE OF  CONSERVATISM. YOU ARE OR YOU AREN&#39;T.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SEVERE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SEVERELY CONSERVATIVE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I AGREE WITH WHAT HOWARD JUST SAID BUT I DO HAVE A LITTLE  ASTERISK I WANT TO PUT ON THIS. I THINK WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL  NOT TO MAKE MUCH MORE OF THIS  ELECTION IN NEW JERSEY AS WE  SHOULD AS A PROJECTION INTO THE  FUTURE SIMPLY BECAUSE CHRISTIE  IS RUNNING FOR RE-ELECTION  AGAINST A DEMOCRAT THAT NOBODY  SUPPORTED. SO THERE IS NO REAL CHALLENGE OR PUSHBACK ON CHRISTIE&#39;S POLICIES  AS GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA -- OF  NEW JERSEY AND HOW VOTERS REALLY FEEL. IF HE&#39;S THE ONLY THING STANDING  THEY WANT TO SUPPORT, OKAY,  FINE. IN A TRUE KPE RACE, THAT&#39;S WHERE THE RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD. WHEN YOU GET INTO A REPUBLICAN  PRIMARY WHERE REPUBLICANS PLAY  DIFFERENT FOR CHRIS CHRISTIE,  THAT&#39;S A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; MAY I JUST FOR THE RECORD  AGREE WHOLEHEARTEDLY WITH  CHAIRMAN MICHAEL STEELE ON THIS  POINT. THERE&#39;S ONE OTHER THING THAT  CHRIS CHRISTIE HAS THAT NO OTHER REPUBLICAN RUNNING IN A  STATEWIDE OR NATIONAL ELECTION  CAN REPLICATE. HE&#39;S PHYSICALLY SEPARATED  ELECTION FROM CORY BOOKER. HE&#39;S BUDDIES, FINE, HAS A GOOD  RELATIONSHIP WITH BOOKER BUT HE  WASN&#39;T WILLING TO RUN ON THE  SAME BALLOT WITH HIM. HE UNDERSTOOD IF YOU HAD  ENTHUSIASTIC DEMOCRATIC  PARTICIPATION IN THE RACE MAYBE  HIS SUPPORT ACROSS THE AISLE --  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK PROGRESSIVES WOULD BE DOING THEMSELVES A DOES SERVICE, IF CHRIS CHRISTIE GETS THROUGH  THE PRIMARY, IF HE DOES HE&#39;S A  VERY FORMIDABLE --  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; PRIMARY PROCESS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CORY BOOKER, WHAT IF THEY ARE RUNNING AGAINST EACH OTHER.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU SAID NOBODY RAN AGAINST  HIM. THERE&#39;S A REASON NOBODY RAN  AGAINST HIM. HIS POLL NUMBERS WERE GOOD. CORY BOOKER COULD HAVE RUN  AGAINST HIM FOR GOVERNOR.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHO WOULD HAVE WON.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I DON&#39;T THINK CORY BOOKER  WOULD HAVE WON. WE LOVE CORY BOOKER. WE LOVE CORY BOOKER IN NEW YORK  CITY. IF CORY BOOKER THOUGHT HE COULD  BEAT CHRIS CHRISTIE FOR  GOVERNOR, HE WOULD HAVE RUN  AGAINST HIM.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BEFORE WE GO, REALLY QUICK,  SASHA, WHAT IS ALSO OF NOTE AND  SHOULD NOTTEN BE MARGINALIZED IN THIS COMPETITION IS THE AMOUNT  OF MONEY. AS OF THURSDAY OUTSIDE  SPINNEDING FOR CANDIDATES IN THE JERSEY RACE TOPPED $35 MILLION,  TWICE SINCE 2009, HIGHEST BY ANY STATE EXCEPT CALIFORNIA. WE&#39;RE JUST GOING TO SEE MORE AND MORE MONEY THROWN AT THE STATE  LEVEL RACES, BECAUSE AS WE SAID  BEFORE, THIS IS WHERE THE ACTION IS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE MONEY IS SPENT DOWN  BALLOT BIG LEGISLATIVE DISTRICTS IN NEW JERSEY. DEMOCRATS ARE TARGETING VOTERS  CALLED CHRISTIE-CRATS. THEY ARE TRYING TO SPLIT THE  TICKET AND LEGISLATURE SERVE AS  A CHECK ON THEM IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT WILL BE AN INTERESTING  WEDNESDAY MORNING.

AMONG THE MEASURES ON THE BALLOT TODAY, HIGHER IN COME TAXES IN  COLORADO TO RAISE MONEY FOR  PUBLIC EDUCATION. ANOTHER COLORADO TAX ON NEWLY  LEGALIZED MARIJUANA. A PROPOSED LABEL ON GENETICALLY  MODIFIED FOOD IN WASHINGTON  STATE. IN NEW YORK AUTHORIZATION OF  SEVEN CASINOS OSTENSIBLY TO  INCREASE AID TO SCHOOLS AND  PROPERTY TAXES. IN NEW JERSEY A CONSTITUTIONAL  AMENDMENT TO RAISE THE MINIMUM  WAGE TO $8.25 AN HOUR, A DOLLAR  MORE THAN THE FEDERAL STANDARD  OF $7.25. GOVERNOR, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT  ENTHUSIASM AND GETTING PEOPLE TO THE POLLS. THE RAFT OF PROGRESSIVE  MEASURES, DOES THAT HELP WITH  TURNOUT, DO YOU THINK? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT DOES IF THEY GET A LOT OF  PUBLICITY. IF IT&#39;S A VIBRANT CAMPAIGN  DRIVES TURNOUT. IF IT&#39;S ON THE BALLOT, PROBABLY  NOT ENOUGH.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; PROGRESSIVE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; OSTENSIBLY RAISE MONEY IN  SCHOOLS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SEE THOSE PROGRESSIVES. ALWAYS FOR THE CHILDREN. PLEASE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WAKE UP. WE&#39;RE TALKING ABOUT GMO, POT  LEGALIZATION. YOU TALK ABOUT GAY --  ANTI-MARRIAGE EQUALITY ISSUES IN 2004, 11 STATES PASSED THEM BY  MORE THAN 57%. THIS YEAR, 2012 BALLOT  INITIATIVES, MINNESOTA -- LAST  YEAR MINNESOTA FAILED TO BAN  SAME-SEX MARRIAGE, MARYLAND  MAINE, WASHINGTON LEGALIZED,  COLORADO AND WASHINGTON  LEGALIZED POT. THERE IS A SHIFT HAPPENING IN  THIS COUNTRY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WITHIN 10 YEARS GAY MARRIAGE  HAS COME ON THE OTHER SIDE. SORT OF AN ENTHUSIASM FOR  YOUNGER VOTERS ON THE  PROGRESSIVE SIDE. I LOOK AT COLORADO, A STATE  FAIRLY CONSERVATIVE WHEN I WAS  GROWING UP THERE, WHICH IS NOW  ON THE CUTTING EDGE IN TERMS OF  GUN LEGISLATION, IN TERMS OF POT LEGALIZATION. IT&#39;S SORT OF WHERE THINGS ARE  GOING, BOTH BECAUSE THE  DEMOGRAPHICS ARE CHANGING.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; COLORADO, THE ONE TO ME  THAT&#39;S THE MOST INTERESTING OF  ALL OF THEM, RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE PEOPLE ARE REALLY FOR THAT  BECAUSE IT DOESN&#39;T REALLY AFFECT THEM. INCREASING TAXES FOR EDUCATION. THAT&#39;S A CRUCIAL ISSUE. IT&#39;S THE HEART AND SOUL OF  PROGRESSIVE AGENDA. POLLING PEOPLE SAY THEY ARE  WILLING TO PAY A LITTLE MORE IF  THE MONEY IS GOING TO GO TO  SCHOOLS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CAN I SAY SOMETHING ABOUT  THAT? THIS IS ONE OF THE REALLY  MISNOMERS ABOUT THIS KIND OF  SPENDING, WE&#39;RE GOING TO RAISE  TAXES FOR EDUCATION. UNLESS THAT MONEY IS IN A  LOCKBOX, THOSE KIDS AREN&#39;T GOING TO SEE THAT 25% ON TOP.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CAN WE TALK ABOUT COLORADO,  MAYOR BLOOMBERG TEAMED WITH BILL GATES AND TEACHERS UNION WHICH  ARE USUALLY AT ODDS. IT DOES A NUMBER OF THINGS,  RAISES TAXES TO FUND EDUCATION  BUT GOES ONLY FOR EDUCATION.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HAS A LOCKBOX.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; EQUALIZES FUNDING, POOR AREAS ARE GOING TO DO BETTER THAT  HISTORICALLY HAVE DONE WORSE AND REQUIRES REFORMS AROUND TEACHER  COMPETENCY AND EXCELLENCE IN THE CLASSROOM. IT&#39;S TOTALLY COMPREHENSIVE. IT&#39;S BOTH REFORMERS LIKE MIKE  BLOOMBERG AND BILL GATES AND  TEACHERS RUN COMING TOGETHER TO  GET THIS DONE. IT&#39;S VERY CLOSE, HOPEFULLY WILL  PASS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I WILL ALSO NOTE IF WE&#39;RE  TALKING ABOUT COLORADO A STATE  TURNING BLUE, DEEP PURPLE,  PROGRESSIVE MEASURES ON THE  BALLOT, 11 OF COLORADO&#39;S 64  COUNTIES ARE EXPECTED TO PASS A  REFERENDUM IN FAVOR OF SECESSION FROM THE STATE. TO A LARGER POINT, A SHIFT FROM  BLUES, RED TO PURPLE, BUT THE  DEEP RED IS AS ENTRENCHED AS IT  HAS BEEN. IF YOU LOOK AT 1976, LESS THAN A QUARTER AMERICANS WON IN A PLACE WHERE THERE WAS A LANDSLIDE. 2004 ONLY HALF LIVED IN  LANDSLIDE COUNTIES. THE DIVISIONS ARE DEEP.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE SENSE OF ALIENATION AMONG FAR RIGHT, TEA PARTY, THAT IS  THE FOREGOING NARRATIVE GOING  INTO 2016. YOU HAVE A GROUP OF PEOPLE SO  ALIENATED, CULTURE,  DEMOGRAPHICS, COUNTRY, POLITICS  GOING AND EMBODIED IN BARACK  OBAMA BUT LONGER AND DEEPER,  GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO BUSING  IN THE &#39;70s, POST 1964 WORLD. STILL POWERFUL TO CATER TO  ALIENATED VOTERS. THAT&#39;S WHY YOU DON&#39;T SEE A LOT  OF CHANGE. I AGREE WITH MICHAEL STEELE YOU  DON&#39;T SEE BECAUSE CHRIS CHRISTIE WINS SUDDENLY THE REPUBLICAN  PARTY CHANGES, BECAUSE CATERING  TO VOTERS OLDER, BY AND LARGE  RURAL, SOUTH, MIDWEST AND SOME  IN THE CITIES AND SUBURBS AND  EXURBS. THEY ARE ANGRY, REALLY ANGRY AND THEY NEED A PARTY THAT SPEAKS TO THEM AND RIGHT NOW THE  REPUBLICANS HAVE TO DO IT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IF THOSE COLORADO COUNTIES  SECEDE THEY DON&#39;T GET MONEY IN  THE LOCKBOX. WHAT ELECTED OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN SMOKING.","media$content":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":319.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":0,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/K9ys2ysi78z7?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":0,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":500000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":319.386,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":240,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/vvafn6HvNCZ7?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":420,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":800000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":319.386,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":360,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/6PNIEf4_f_YV?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":640,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"media$thumbnails":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"image","plfile$duration":0.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"JPEG","plfile$height":1080,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_wag_3ballot_131105.jpg","plfile$width":1920,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"link":"","pubDate":1383676800000,"plmedia$defaultThumbnailUrl":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_wag_3ballot_131105.jpg","nnd$associatedPlaylist":{"href":"http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_52794037"},"nnd$brand":"MSNBC","nnd$bureau":"30RockNY","nnd$bviAssetId":"n_wag_3ballot_131105","nnd$canonicalUrl":{"href":"http://www.msnbc.com/now-with-alex-wagner/watch/progressive-ballot-measures-indicating-shift-61439043945"},"nnd$distributionProfile":["MSN-CA"],"nnd$firstAiredAtUtc":1383672954000,"nnd$lastAiredAtUtc":1383672954000,"nnd$lastEditorialChangeAtUtc":1383676847000,"nnd$longTitle":"Progressive ballot measures indicating shift?","nnd$playCount30":1654,"nnd$playCountDay":690,"nnd$playCountYear":1326,"nnd$requiresCaptioning":true,"nnd$shortDescription":"The 2013 ballot measures include a raise in the minimum wage, legalizing marijuana and funding for education.","nnd$source":"NOW","nnd$sourceId":"nnd_45258737","nnd$sourceUrlSlug":"now-with-alex-wagner","nnd$titleUrlSlug":"progressive-ballot-measures-indicating-shift","nnd$videoType":"Broadcast","nnd$workbenchId":"53467786"},{"$xmlns":{"nnd":"http://partners.nbcnews.com/nnd_mrss"},"guid":"n_wag_4crack_131105","title":"Toronto mayor admits to smoking crack","author":"","description":"After months of controversy, Toronto Mayor Rob Ford has confirmed that he indeed smoked crack.","media$availableDate":1383676440000,"media$expirationDate":4459516440000,"media$categories":[{"media$name":"MSNBC/Highlights","media$scheme":"","media$label":""},{"media$name":"Cable/Politics/All","media$scheme":"","media$label":""},{"media$name":"Cable/Society","media$scheme":"","media$label":""},{"media$name":"MSNBC/Issues/Society","media$scheme":"","media$label":""},{"media$name":"MSNBC/Topics/Franchise/Best of last night","media$scheme":"","media$label":""}],"media$copyright":"","media$copyrightUrl":"","media$credits":[],"media$keywords":"","media$ratings":[],"media$countries":[],"media$excludeCountries":true,"media$text":"&gt;&gt;&gt; AFTER MONTHS OF CONTROVERSY, TORONTO MAYOR ROB FORD HAS  CONFIRMED THAT HE, INDEED,  SMOKED CRACK.

IN MINNEAPOLIS THEY WILL USE  RANK CHOICE VOTING SELECTING  FIRST, SECOND, AND THIRD CHOICES FROM AMONG 35 MAYORAL CANDIDATES INCLUDING AN OCCUPY WALL STREET  ACTIVIST NAMED CAPTAIN JACK  SPARROW. BUT OF COURSE. BUT IT IS BILL DE BLASIO IN THE  NEW YORK RACE THAT HOLDS  IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DEMOCRATIC  PARTY. WITH TALK OF A NEW PROGRESSIVE  KPERMT IN THE NATION&#39;S LARGEST  CITY. DE BLASIO RAN AWAY WITH THE  DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY BY  SUCCESSFULLY TAPPING INTO  BLOOMBERG FATIGUE, EARLY OPTION  TO ITS CONTROVERSIAL STOP AND  FRISK POLICY, ALL OF WHICH WAS  PART OF A GAME CHANGING TV SPOT  NOW SIMPLY CALLED THE AD  FEATURING HIS 16-YEAR-OLD SON  DANTE TALKING ABOUT POLICE  TACTICS. ASKED TO SUM IN WORLD VIEW ONE  PART ROOSEVELT NEW DEAL, ONE  PART EUROPEAN SOCIAL DEMOCRACY  AND ONE PART LIBERATION  THEOLOGY. IF HE SHOULD WIN, THERE WILL  INEVITABLY BE QUESTIONS, HOW  WILL DE BLASIO MANAGE A $70  BILLION BUDGET AND 300,000  EMPLOYEES. WILL HE GOVERNOR AS PROGRESSIVE  OR CLINTON WORLD OPERATIVE THAT  HAS DEFINED HIS CAREER. HOWARD WILSON, THIS BLOCK IS FOR YOU. YOU ONCE SAID -- ONCE, IN  AUGUST --  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SO LONG AGO.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; DE BLASIO WOULD REPRESENT A  U-TURN BACK TO THE &#39;70s. THERE&#39;S HONESTLY SOME NEW  YORKERS PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT  THAT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT HIM AND THE  SORT OF FUTURE MAYORSHIP OF BILL DE BLASIO IF IT COMES TO THAT,  DO YOU THINK HE WILL BE MORE  PRAGMATIC OR PROGRESSIVE. THAT STATEMENT ABOUT WORLD VIEW  WILL BE HA HERETIC.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; $70 MILLION BUDGE, 300,000  EMPLOYEES, A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE  HAVE COME TO EXPECT SOME LEVEL  OF COMPETENCY IN GOVERNMENT,  CRIME IS VERY LOW, AT AN  ALL-TIME LOW. I CAN GIVE MY WONDERFUL --  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE THE BIKE NEW YORK  CITY.ORG HELMET AS PROOF OF  COMPETENCE OF OUR CITY  GOVERNMENT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I&#39;M GLAD HE&#39;S NO LONGER GOING TO RIP UP THE BIKE LANES. THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT THING FOR  ME AS A VOTER AND A CITIZEN. SOMETIMES WHEN YOU GET INTO THE  OFFICE THE RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD AND REALITY STRIKES AND YOU  RECOGNIZE YOU CAN&#39;T DO  EVERYTHING YOU PROMISED TO DO  DURING THE CAMPAIGN. HAVING SAID, THAT I&#39;VE KNOWN  BILL FOR A VERY LONG TIME. HE&#39;S A SINCERE PROGRESSIVE. HE&#39;S SOMEBODY WHO BELIEVES THESE THINGS DEEPLY. IT WASN&#39;T JUST A TRANSFORMATION  DURING THE CAMPAIGN. I REMEMBER WHEN HE WAS RUNNING  HILLARY CLINTON&#39;S CAMPAIGN IN  1999 TALKING ABOUT THESE KINDS  OF ISSUES. HE CARES ABOUT THIS ISSUES. I THINK HE&#39;S GOING TO DO WHAT HE CAN TO IMPLEMENT HIS VISION. NEW YORK CITY HAS A WAY  SOMETIMES OF PUSHING BACK ON  MAYORS WHEN THEY TRY TO DO  SOMETHING LIKE THAT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN  CAMPAIGNING AND GOVERNING,  ESPECIALLY FOR AN EXECUTIVE  OFFICE. AS A LEGISLATOR, WE WERE  DISCUSSING THIS EARLIER. CAN YOU STICK TO YOUR VIEWS  BECAUSE YOU DON&#39;T HAVE TO  ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING. AS A MAYOR OR GOVERNOR YOU DO. THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION, OF THE ENVIRONMENT HE&#39;S GOING TO  ACT IN IS GOING TO INHERENTLY  TEMPER BILL&#39;S VIEWS. FOR EXAMPLE, ONE OF THE THINGS I WANTED TO DO BECAUSE MAKE SURE  PENNSYLVANIA BECAME A STATE,  ADVANCED ENERGY PORTFOLIO  STANDARD ON RENEWABLES. TO GET THAT DONE, I HAVE TO MAKE SOME SIGNIFICANT COMPROMISES  BECAUSE THERE WERE COAL  INTERESTS IN PENNSYLVANIA, BIG  OIL AND GAS INTERESTS, ET  CETERA. SO YOU FIND THE ECONOMIC  REALITIES OF MAKING GOVERNMENT  WORK WILL TO AN EXTENT NOT MAKE  YOU CHANGE YOUR VIEWS BUT TEMPER YOUR VIEWS A LITTLE BIT. I THINK BILL IS A SMART GUY, AND I THINK HE WILL ADAPT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I&#39;VE GOT TO ASK YOU,  CHAIRMAN, WE TALK A LOT ABOUT  THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BEING UNDER THE SWELL OF THE TEA PARTY. WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE FULLY  UNDER THE SPELL, THEY HAVE BEEN  VERY RESPONSIVE TO THE TEA PARTY IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY  AND I THINK JUST THE NATIONAL  SORT OF DEBATE AND CERTAINLY IN  THE MOST RECENT GOVERNMENT  SHUTDOWN. THE LEFT HAS NOT BEEN NEARLY AS  ATTENTIVE OR RESPONSIVE TO THE  HARD CORE PROGRESSIVE BASE. YOU SEE -- DE BLASIO IS  INTERESTING INSOFAR AS -- I  AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR AND  HOWARD, THINGS ARE DIFFERENT  ONCE YOU GET TO OFFICE. HE&#39;S BEEN UNABASHEDLY IN THIS  CAMPAIGN IN A WAY THAT ALMOST  NOBODY OTHER THAN ELIZABETH  WARREN HAS BEEN. I WONDER IF THAT&#39;S A CHANGE ON  THE LEFT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I DON&#39;T KNOW IF IT&#39;S A  CHANGE. I DON&#39;T THINK YOU CAN  EXTRAPOLATE IT OUT TO  PROGRESSIVES IN OTHER PARTS OF  THE NORTHEAST OR CERTAINLY THE  SOUTH OR THE WEST. I THINK IN TERMS OF NEW YORK  BEING NEW YORK, IT DOES SEND A  SIGNAL AS WE HEAR THINGS FROM  THE WEST AND HOW IT IMPACTS US  ON THE EAST, THERE COULD BE A  BELLWETHER MOMENT FOR PROGRESS I WAS WITHIN THE PARTY WHICH SETS  UP AN INTERESTING DYNAMIC FOR  2016 WHERE YOU HAVE THIS, YOU  KNOW, PROGRESSIVENESS EITHER  CATCHING HOLD AND GETTING SOME  REAL STEAM BEHIND IT AND LOOKING FOR THAT PROGRESSIVE CANDIDATE  TO CARRY THEIR BANNER OR IS THIS JUST A ONE OFF BECAUSE IT&#39;S NEW  YORK AND DE BLASIO IS ABLE TO  SELL IT HERE. TO THE POINT ABOUT GOVERNING, WE SAW WITH BLOOMBERG WHEN HE TRIED SOMETHING MOST FOLKS WOULD  CONSIDER PROGRESSIVES ON THE  SIDE OF YOUR SODA, THERE WAS  PUSH BACK FROM PEOPLE. SO HOW THE PEOPLE RESPOND TO  THIS PROGRESSIVE AGENDA ALSO  MATTERS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, ONE THING, AS  SOMEBODY WHO LIVED IN NEW YORK  CITY UNDER GIULIANI, ONE OF THE  THINGS THAT SETS THE SCENE IS  POLICE. SO MANY FELT ALIENATED AT  DIFFERENT TIMES UNDER DIFFERENT  MAYORS WAS THE POLICING ISSUE. ONE THING DE BLASIO WOULD BE TO  SET THE TONE IS WALK AWAY FROM  THE APPEAL.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HE HAS NOT SAID HE WOULD STOP STOP AND FRISK.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HE WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY MODIFY IT SO IT&#39;S NOT BLANKET  PROFILING. HE&#39;S GOING OUT TO CLING TO STOP  AND FRISK, NEGATED GOOD THINGS  HE MANAGED TO DO. DE BLASIO CHANGING THAT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I WANT TO ASK YOU, THE MAYOR  HAS DONE A LOT PEOPLE ARE VERY,  VERY HAPPY WITH. THERE&#39;S OTHER THINGS HE HAS DONE PEOPLE ARE VERY, VERY UNHAPPY  WITH. IT SEEMS IN THESE LAST DAYS OF  THE ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE OF  THE STROP AND FRISK STUFF THERE  HAS BEEN MORE OF A FOCUS ON  NEGATIVE. WITH DE BLASIO, WON&#39;T SAY  REPUDIATION BUT INCOME EQUALITY, HAPPENING TO THE CITY IN THE  BLOOMBERG ERA, WHAT&#39;S THE  FEELING IN BLOOMBERG HQ IN TERMS OF THE LEGACY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THIS MAYOR HAS BEEN THE BEST  IN THE CITY. HISTORY WILL REMEMBER THAT. I DON&#39;T THINK IT&#39;S GOING TO TAKE VERY LONG FOR PEOPLE TO MISS HIM ONCE HE&#39;S GONE. HE&#39;S BEEN IN OFFICE FOR 12  YEARS. THIS IS THE TOUGHES MEDIA  ENVIRONMENT. &quot;WALL STREET JOURNAL&quot; HAD HIS  NUMBERS AT 47, 49. I&#39;M WORKING HARD TO GET THOSE  NUMBERS UP TO 50. HE SAYS TO ME I&#39;D LIKE TO LEAVE  WITH MY APPROVAL RATINGS IN THE  30s. IT MEANS WE HAVEN&#39;T DONE ENOUGH. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SO BLOOMBERG STYLE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK NOT ONLY WILL HISTORY LOOK BACK AND SAY HE WAS A GREAT MAYOR, I THINK IT&#39;S GOING TO  TAKE PEOPLE ABOUT TWO OR THREE  WEEKS TO MISS THE GUY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE&#39;VE GOT TO LEAVE IT THERE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BY CHRISTMAS MAYOR BLOOMBERG  IN THE 50s, HIGH 60s.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU CAN TAKE THAT TO THE  TRACK. THANK YOU ALL.","media$content":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":500000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":494.494,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":240,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/9C02THMyRkya?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":420,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":494.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":0,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/wg3oTqCwJZc3?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":0,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"media$thumbnails":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"image","plfile$duration":0.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"JPEG","plfile$height":1080,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_wag_4nyc_131105.jpg","plfile$width":1920,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"link":"","pubDate":1383676140000,"plmedia$defaultThumbnailUrl":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_wag_4nyc_131105.jpg","nnd$associatedPlaylist":{"href":"http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_52794037"},"nnd$brand":"MSNBC","nnd$bureau":"30RockNY","nnd$bviAssetId":"n_wag_4nyc_131105","nnd$canonicalUrl":{"href":"http://www.msnbc.com/now-with-alex-wagner/watch/life-after-bloomberg-61444163834"},"nnd$distributionProfile":["MSN-CA"],"nnd$firstAiredAtUtc":1383673752000,"nnd$lastAiredAtUtc":1383673752000,"nnd$lastEditorialChangeAtUtc":1383677077000,"nnd$longTitle":"Life after Bloomberg","nnd$playCount30":1420,"nnd$playCountDay":608,"nnd$playCountYear":1120,"nnd$requiresCaptioning":true,"nnd$shortDescription":"If Bill De Blasio is elected as New York City mayor Tuesday it could prove to be a bellwether moment for progressives.","nnd$source":"NOW","nnd$sourceId":"nnd_45258737","nnd$sourceUrlSlug":"now-with-alex-wagner","nnd$titleUrlSlug":"life-after-bloomberg","nnd$videoType":"Broadcast","nnd$workbenchId":"53467982"},{"$xmlns":{"nnd":"http://partners.nbcnews.com/nnd_mrss"},"guid":"n_wag_1aca_131104","title":"Were ACA failures a long time coming?","author":"","description":"Hugo Lindgren, Josh Barro, Ari Melber and Juliet Eilperin discuss reports that White House aides risked Obamacare’s implementation for political gain.","media$availableDate":1383591240000,"media$expirationDate":4459431240000,"media$categories":[{"media$name":"MSNBC/Highlights","media$scheme":"","media$label":""},{"media$name":"Cable/Health/All","media$scheme":"","media$label":""},{"media$name":"MSNBC/Issues/Health","media$scheme":"","media$label":""},{"media$name":"Cable/Politics/All","media$scheme":"","media$label":""},{"media$name":"Cable/Society","media$scheme":"","media$label":""},{"media$name":"MSNBC/Issues/Society","media$scheme":"","media$label":""},{"media$name":"MSNBC/Topics/Franchise/Best of last night","media$scheme":"","media$label":""},{"media$name":"MSNBC/Topics/General/Affordable Care Act","media$scheme":"","media$label":""}],"media$copyright":"","media$copyrightUrl":"","media$credits":[],"media$keywords":"","media$ratings":[],"media$countries":[],"media$excludeCountries":true,"media$text":"THE FAILURE OF THE LAUNCH OF  HEALTHCARE.GOV WAS A LONG TIME  COMING.

IT WASN&#39;T ONLY MISMANAGEMENT  THAT DOOMD DOOMED THE ROLLOUT,  FEAR OF REPUBLICAN SABOTAGE AND  CONCERNS OVER THE 2012 ELECTION  SET THE DISASTER TWO YEARS  BEFORE THE SITE LAUNCHED. &quot;WASHINGTON POST&quot; REPORTS THE  WHITE HOUSE SLOWED DOWN  IMPORTANT REGULATIONS THAT HAD  BEEN DRAFTED MONTHS EARLIER, TO  WAIT UNTIL JUST MONTHS AFTER  PRESIDENT OBAMA&#39;S ELECTION. MEDICARE&#39;S TOP RISK ANALYST, IT  WAS THE PRESIDENT&#39;S MOST  SIGNIFICANT DOMESTIC POLICY  ACHIEVEMENT AND THE VERY AIDES  THAT PUSHED THE LAW THROUGH  CONGRESS WERE RISKING BAD  IMPLEMENTATION FOR A SHORT-TERM  POLITICAL GAIN. REGARDING THE PRESIDENT&#39;S  INFAMOUS PROMISE IF YOU LIKE IT, YOU CAN KEEP IT, SOME WHITE  HOUSE POLICY ADVISERS OBJECTED  TO THE BREADTH OF KEEP YOUR  PLAN, THEY WERE OVERRULED. IN RECENT DAYS, CURRENT AIDES  HAVE DOWNPLAYED OR DISMISSED THE DAMAGE OF THOSE WORDS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE VAST MAJORITY OF  AMERICANS THAT STATEMENT WILL  HOLD TRUE. FOR THIS SMALL GROUP OF  AMERICANS IT HASN&#39;T. THE CALAMITOUS THING HERE THE  WEBSITE WASN&#39;T UP. MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO TRANSITION WILL GET BETTER  INSURANCE FOR LESS MONEY BUT  THEY CAN&#39;T TELL NOW.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ANY DEBATE REGARDING THE  PRESIDENT&#39;S STATEMENT EVER TOOK  PLACE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I DON&#39;T RECALL SIGNIFICANT  DISCUSSIONS AROUND SOME OF THE  VERBIAGE ON THIS TO BE 100%  HONEST WITH YOU.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; DO YOU AGREE IT WAS A WRONG  MOVE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CERTAINLY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ONE FORMER SENIOR  ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL SAID THE LAW IS CRAFTED BY WHITE HOUSE  AND LAWMAKERS, SOME WHITE HOUSE  POLICY ADVISERS OBJECTED TO  BREADTH OF KEEP YOUR PLAN  PROMISE. THEY WERE OVERRULED BY POLITICAL AIDES. THAT IS TRUE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT IS NOT MY RECOLLECTION  AT ALL OF THAT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IN THE END IT IS LIKELY WITH  SO MANY ACA PROBLEMS, THE  INTENTIONS MAY HAVE BEEN GOOD  BUT EXECUTION WAS FLAWED. AS FORMER WHITE HOUSE  SPEECHWRITER JOHN FAVRO TOLD  &quot;WALL STREET JOURNAL,&quot; THE AIM  WAS TO MAKE IT AS SIMPLE AS  POSSIBLE WHILE STILL BEING TRUE. EDITOR OF THE MAGAZINE, POLITICS BUSINESS INSIDER JOSH BARROW AND CO-HOST OF NBC&#39;S THE CYCLE ARI  MELBER. JOINING ME FROM D.C. THE WHITE  HOUSE REPORTER JULIA HALPERIN. CONGRATULATIONS ON A BIG STORY  WHO READS IN MANY WAYS LIKE  WHODONEIT. HEARTBREAKING IF YOU&#39;RE A FAN OF IN INSURING MILLIONS OF  UNINSURED AMERICANS. ONE THING I NOTICED THROUGHOUT  THE PIECE THAT YOU GUYS RAN THIS WEEKEND WAS THE FACT THAT THE  PRESIDENT FROM THE VERY MOMENT  THIS LAW WAS PASSED SAID AND  PRIORITIZED THE DEVELOPMENT OF  THE WEBSITE. AS YOU WRITE, HOURS AFTER THE  BILL HAD BEEN ENACTED, THE  PRESIDENT STOOD ON TRUMAN  BALCONY WITH CHAMPAGNE TOAST  WITH HIS WEARY STAFF AND PUT  THEM ON NOTICE, THEY NEEDED TO  GET STARTED CARRYING OUT THE LAW THE VERY NEXT MORNING. GIVEN THAT, HIS ATTENTION AND  FOCUS AND REITERATION OF THE  IMPORTANCE OF THE WEBSITE, HOW  COME THIS WAS -- THE PROBLEMS  WITH IT WERE NEVER RUN UP THE  CHAIN OF COMMAND? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S A GOOD QUESTION. ONE THING I WOULD CLARIFY, I  THINK IT WAS VERY FOCUSED ON  IMPLEMENTATION THE MOMENT AFTER  IT PASSED. IN TERMS OF THE WEBSITE, THE  PRESIDENT&#39;S FOCUS FROM WHAT WE  UNDERSTAND KICKED IN SIX MONTHS  AGO. THAT&#39;S WHEN HE STARTED SEEING IF THE WEBSITE DOESN&#39;T WORK,  NOTHING ELSE MATTERS. IN TERMS OF THIS BROADER  QUESTION, SOMETHING EVERYONE,  WHETHER IN PUNISHMENT OACROSS  THE COUNTRY IS ASKING ABOUT, I  THINK WHAT IT COMES DOWN IS  ESSENTIALLY THE WHITE HOUSE WAS  TALKING TO SENIOR OFFICIALS AT  HEALTH AND HUMAN OFFICIALS  TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS  GOING ON WITH ONLINE ENROLLMENT  SYSTEM AND THOSE FOLKS WERE  TALKING TO LOWER LEVEL AGENCY  OFFICIALS WHO IN MANY WAYS WERE  AFRAID OF FAILURE, AFRAID OF  ADMITTING THIS SYSTEM WASN&#39;T  WORKING. WHILE IT&#39;S A LITTLE UNCLEAR WHAT THEY WERE COMMUNICATING TO  HIGHER UPS IN HHS, THAT&#39;S WHERE  THERE WAS A BREAKDOWN OF  COMMUNICATION SO THE WHITE HOUSE WAS TOTALLY UNPREPARED FOR THE  PROBLEMS WE&#39;VE SEEN SINCE THE  LAUNCH OCTOBER 1st.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT FEAR MUST HAVE BEEN SO  PRONOUNCED. THERE&#39;S AN ANECDOTE YOU END THE  PIECE WITH. IT&#39;S ALMOST TRAGIC AS YOU WRITE. SOME STAFF MEMBERS WORRY THE  WEBSITE WOULD FAIL RIGHT IN  FRONT OF THE PRESIDENT&#39;S AIDES  AS IT WAS TESTED OUT. A FEW SECRETLY ROOTED FOR IT TO  FAIL SO PERHAPS THE WHITE HOUSE  WOULD WAIT TO OPEN THE EXCHANGE  UNTIL IT WAS READY. HAVE YOU TO ASK YOURSELF, WHY  DIDN&#39;T ONE OF THE PEOPLE  STANDING IN THE ROOM SAY THIS  ISN&#39;T GOING TO WORK. IT&#39;S NOT READY YET.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION. WE DON&#39;T KNOW. THE PRESIDENT AND COMMUNICATIONS TRIED TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL FOR  COMFORTABLE ABOUT ADMITTING  WHETHER THERE WERE PROBLEMS. AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY HAD  KNOWN THIS WAS SO IMPORTANT TO  THE PRESIDENT AND TO THE WHITE  HOUSE THAT THEY WERE UNWILLING  TO SAY WHAT OBVIOUSLY BECAME  OBVIOUS TO AMERICANS AS SOON AS  THE WEBSITE LAUNCHED.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I WANT TO OPEN THIS UP TO  FRIENDS IN NEW YORK WHO ARE IN  COORDINATED BLUE SHIRTS AND  BEAUTIFUL TIES. THANK YOU FOR ENSURING THERE&#39;S A REAL UNIFORM FOR TODAY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HUGO, WE READ THESE ACCOUNTS  AND THEY DO READ LIKE THE  POSEIDON ADVENTURE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S NOT MUCH BETTER DESPITE  JULIETTE&#39;S EXCELLENT REPORT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THERE IS A HOPE IT WILL ALL  WORK OUT. NONETHELESS, TRACING THESE  ERRORS, IT&#39;S PAINFUL. I KEEP USING THE WORDS PAINFUL  AND TRAGIC. YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT THE  ROLLOUT OF THIS. THAT NO ONE PIPED UP.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU LOOK, THINK BACK TO YOUR  OWN FIRST JOB WHEN YOU&#39;RE A  LOWER LEVEL PERSON AND WORKING  ON SOMETHING THAT&#39;S NOT WORKING  OUT, YOU DO KIND OF KEEP A  SECRET AND HORDE IT AND WORRY  AND DON&#39;T GO RUNNING TO YOUR  BOSS. WE DID A STORY ABOUT THE LAUNCH  OF iPHONE. WHEN STEVE JOBS SET UP THE BIG  EVENT. THEY HAD SOMETHING PUT TOGETHER  WITH DUCT TAPE AND WIRE. IT WAS LIKE -- HE INSISTED ON  DOING IT LIVE, STEVE JOBS. HE WAS PUSHING IT THROUGH. IT LOOKED LIKE THE MOST  RIDICULOUS RISK TAKING YOU COULD POSSIBLY HAVE. SO MUCH RIDING ON IT. THEY COULD NOT BELIEVE IT, THE  ENGINEERS, AS THEY SAT THERE IN  THE AUDIENCE THAT IT WORKED FOR  THE LIVE PRESENTATION. I THINK THERE WAS A KIND OF  WISHFUL THINKING IN THIS PROCESS LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT, MAYBE THE  DUCT TAPE WILL HOLD AND  EVERYBODY AT THE LOWER LEVELS IS LIKE I HOPE, I HOPE, I HOPE. IT DOESN&#39;T. NOW WE&#39;RE IN A DIFFERENT STAGE  OF THE PROCESS. NOW WE UNDER THE MISTAKES THAT  WERE MADE. NOW REALLY IT&#39;S A QUESTION OF  HOW QUICKLY THE ADMINISTRATION  CAN REGAIN ITS COMPETENCY AND  COME IN THERE AND SAY NOW WE  KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE. WE CAN&#39;T KEEP FIGHTING. IT&#39;S NOT TIME TO FINGER POINT  AND BLAME. IT&#39;S TIME TO BE HOW DO WE GET  EXCHANGES UP AND RUNNING  EFFICIENTLY SO WE GET THE  EFFECTS WE NEED FROM THE AMOUNT  OF SIGNUPS, GET THE ACTUAL  SYSTEM FUNCTIONING. I THINK IT&#39;S -- IF I&#39;M IN THE  ADMINISTRATION I&#39;M NOT SITTING  AROUND BEING LIKE WHOSE FAULT IS THIS? WHOSE FAULT IS THAT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE QUESTION WILL BE ASKED AT SOME POINT, JOSH, IS THE  PRESIDENT ON THE HOOK FOR ANY OF THIS. THERE&#39;S VAST AMOUNTS OF  OBSTRUCTION BOTH AT THE STATE  LEVEL AND CONGRESS IN TERMS OF  FUNDING THIS THING, OPTING OUT  OF THE EXCHANGES. THERE&#39;S INCOMPETENCE. PROBLEMS THE PRESIDENT NEVER  COULD HAVE TROUBLE SHOT. AS JULIETTE POINTS OUT HE WAS  MORE ENGAGED IN THE LAST SIX  MONTHS. SHOULD HE HAVE BEEN MORE ENGAGED A YEAR BEFORE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S POSSIBLE TO BUILD A  WORKING EXCHANGE AS WE CAN SEE  14 STATES AND DISTRICT OF  COLUMBIA HAVE WEBSITES THAT ARE  VARIOUS DEGREES OF WORKING. I DON&#39;T THINK IT&#39;S FAIR FOR THE  WHITE HOUSE TO SAY THIS IS AN  IMPOSSIBLE TASK. WE COULDN&#39;T HAVE DONE IT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I DON&#39;T THINK THEY ARE SAYING THAT, ARE THEY? I THINK THEY ARE SAYING  COMPLICATED TASK, SYSTEMS  FAILED, SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER, NOT EXCUSABLE. I DON&#39;T THINK THEY ARE SAYING  IT&#39;S IMPOSSIBLE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THEY ARE SORT OF TALKING  ABOUT IT LIKE IT&#39;S REASONABLE  THEY DID AS BADLY AS THEY DID  UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. IF THE THING IS BASICALLY FIXED  IN A MONTH WE WILL MORE OR LESS  FORGET ABOUT THIS EPISODE THEE  YEARS AREA. IT WILL BE LIKE MEDICARE PART D  AND LOOK BACK, HEY, DO YOU  REMEMBER THAT TIME WHEN THE  LAUNCH LOOKED ROCKY FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS. THE PROBLEM IS IT&#39;S NOT CLEAR  THEY CAN FIX THE EXCHANGE  ARCHITECT YOU&#39;RE IN A MONTH. IF THEY CAN, WHY DIDN&#39;T THEY DO  IT BEFORE THE LAUNCH. IF IT DRAGS INTO THE WINTER, THE ENROLLMENT DEADLINE IT BECOMES A SUBSTANTIVE PROBLEM FOR THE LAW. THAT WILL DETERMINE HOW THE  WHITE HOUSE IS VIEWED ON THIS. ATTEMPTS TO MESSAGE IT DAY TO  DAY DON&#39;T MATTER. FUTURES THE SUBSTANTIVE THING TO WORK THE MESSAGING WILL BE FINE. IF YOU DON&#39;T GET IT TO WORK,  NOTHING WILL MAKE IT BETTER.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SOUNDS BITES FROM CURRENT  ADVISERS PUSHING BACK ON THE  REPORTING THAT HE -- THAT THERE  WAS AN INTERNAL DEBATE BETWEEN  POLICY ADVISERS AND POLITICAL  ADVISERS OVER WHETHER THE  PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE SAID  CATEGORICALLY IF YOU LIKE YOUR  PLAN YOU&#39;RE NOT GOING TO LOSE  IT. I&#39;M OF THE MIND A LOT OF THOSE  PLANS SUCKED. PARDON MY FRENCH. IT&#39;S A GOOD THING FOR AMERICANS  TO HAVE BETTER PLANS. AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS NOT  TRUTHFUL. PEOPLE LOST THEIR PLANS. THE QUESTION AGAIN IS, IS THAT  JUST PART OF A PERFECT STORM  RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF  CREDIBILITY AS THE WHITE HOUSE  IS FIXED AND AMERICANS ARE MORE  FLUENT IN THE TECHNICALITIES AND REALITIES OF ACA? THESE WORDS HAVE IMPORT IN  MONTHS TO COME OR IS THIS TRULY  SORT OF A DAMAGING MARK ON THE  PRESIDENT&#39;S RECORD.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK IT REALLY DEPENDS  WHETHER YOU LOOK AT THIS FROM A  POLITIFACT FACT CHECKING, HOW  MANY PINOCCHIOS DO YOU GET  PERSPECTIVE OR HEALTH CARE  POLICY PERSPECTIVE. THE CHANGE THEY NEEDED IN THE  WORDING IS IF YOU HAVE A  COMPREHENSIVE PLAN OR A STANDARD PLAN, RIGHT? TO SOME DEGREE A LOT OF PLANS  WE&#39;RE TALKING ABOUT ARE PLANS  FROM A HEALTH PERSPECTIVE MANY  PEOPLE FELT WERE MISLEADING TO  THE PEOPLE WHO WERE ON THEM OR  MORE RELATED TO CATASTROPHIC AND NOT REALLY GOING TO MEET THE  MINIMUM STANDARDS THEY WANTED AS THEY REGULATED THE SYSTEM. SO UNFORTUNATE WORD CHOICE YOU  COULD MASSAGE IT ON THE WORDING  AND FACTUAL PIECE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT SEEMS LIKE QUITE A BIT OF  MASSAGING, DOESN&#39;T IT? GO AHEAD.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ALSO, THIS ISN&#39;T QUITE RIGHT. THE WAY PEOPLE ON THE LEFT  TALKING ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL  MARKET WHERE 14 MILLION  AMERICANS GET HEALTH PLANS, ALL  THE PLANS ARE NONSENSE. THEY DON&#39;T REALLY COVER THINGS. THERE ARE BAD PLANS IN THE  INDIVIDUAL MARKET. THERE ARE PERFECTLY GOOD PLANS  IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET. ONE OF THE REASONS PEOPLE GET  CHEAP INSURANCE IN THE  INDIVIDUAL MARKET IS NOT JUST  THAT THEY ARE BUYING A BAD PLAN. THEY ARE YOUNG, HEALTHY PEOPLE  WITH LOW ACTUARIAL RISKS. INSURERS LOOK TO THEM AND SAY I  DON&#39;T THINK YOU&#39;RE GOING TO GET  SICK.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BUT THAT GOES TO THE POLICY  POINT. THE SAME WAY IF YOU MAKE A NEW  RULE THERE ARE GOING TO BE NEW  CARS AND THEY ALL HAVE TO HAVE  SEAT BELTS IN THEM. THE OLD CARS REFITTED WITH SEAT  BELTS OR GO OFF THE MARKET,  THAT&#39;S A REGULATORY RULE. HOW YOU SELL IT, HOW MUCH DETAIL IS PROBLEMATIC. THEY CLEARLY DIDN&#39;T FIND THE  RIGHT BALANCE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HERE IS THE THING. THIS PROBLEM IS DONE. THERE&#39;S NO GOING BACK AND FIXING WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID. HE MADE A MISTAKE. THE WHITE HOUSE HAS TO SPEND  TIME FIXING THE EXCHANGES AND  GETTING THAT DONE. IT&#39;S A GOOD THING TO TALK ABOUT. IT&#39;S NOT THE FIRST TIME IN A  CAMPAIGN SOMEONE SAID SOMETHING  AND REALITY TURNED OUT TO BE  DIFFERENT. HERE IT IS, YOU SHOULD HAVE PUT  ANOTHER ADJECTIVE IN THERE. WAS IT MOSTLY TRUE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; MOSTLY DIDN&#39;T GET YOU THERE. IT REALLY DOESN&#39;T. READ MY LIPS, NO NEW TAXES. THIS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS FOR  HIM.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I WANT TO ASK YOU, GIVEN THE  WAY THIS WAS DEVELOPED, KATHLEEN SEBELIUS COULDN&#39;T HOUSE THE  PEOPLE WORKING ON THE WEBSITE IN HER OFFICE BECAUSE OF VARIOUS  FEARS REGARDING PARTISAN  POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, FUNDING,  A HOST OF ISSUES. ARE YOU MORE CONFIDENT THE  SYSTEM THEY HAVE IN PLACE NOW,  THE FOLKS THEY ARE BRINGING IN,  THE OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS ARE  GOING TO HAVE AN EASIER, LESS  THORNY TIME UNRAVELING PROBLEMS  WITH THIS WEBSITE THEY WOULD  HAVE HAD SIX MONTHS AGO? IT SEEMS THE CLIMATE AROUND THE  ACA WAS NO LESS HEATED THAN IT  WAS PREELECTION.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THERE&#39;S NO QUESTION THEY  OBVIOUSLY HAVE A BETTER  MANAGEMENT IN PLACE, PROPERTY  BACK JEFFREY ZIENTS, FORMER  DIRECTOR, QUITE CAPABLE,  PRESIDENT IS INVOLVED, GETTING  NIGHTLY BRIEFINGS ON IT. THERE&#39;S NO QUESTION THEY HAVE A  MORE CONCERTED FOCUS AND BETTER  MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE FOR GETTING THIS DONE. WHETHER THEY WILL ACTUALLY FIX  THE WEBSITE BY THE END OF  NOVEMBER REMAINS TO BE SEEN  BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A FORMIDABLE  TASK. THAT STILL REMAIN TO BE SEEN.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT IS AN EXHAUSTIVE AND  THOROUGH PIECE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR REPORT,  &quot;WASHINGTON POST.&quot; THAT YOU FOR YOUR TIME.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AFTER THE BREAK, DEBATE OVER  THE FARM BILL FOCUSED ON HOW  MUCH TO SLASH FOOD STAMPS. LAWMAKERS ALSO HAGGLING OVER  SOMETHING ELSE, HOW MUCH TO  INCREASE FARM SUBSIDIES. WE WILL DISCUSS HAVES AND HAVE  NOTS WHEN AGRICULTURE SECRETARY  JOINS US LIVE NEXT ON

DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE BEEN  SUCCESSFUL IN THAT EFFORT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YES. I THINK BARACK OBAMA BECAUSE OF  WHO HE IS, NOBEL PEACE PRIZE  WINNER, CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYER BY TRAINING HAS BEEN ABLE TO  CELTICLY LIBERALS ON THE IDEA  THIS IS A SMARTER WAY OF WAGING  WAR. IN FACT, THERE&#39;S VERY LITTLE NEW IN WAR EXCEPT TECHNOLOGY. BECAUSE OF THE DEBATES THE USE  OF DRONES INSPIRING THIS COUNTRY THERE&#39;S BEEN A FINER POINT. THE U.S. HAS BEEN IN THE  BUSINESS OF ASSASSINATION. OBAMA IS THE FIRST PRESIDENT IN  MODERN TIMES TO ARGUE THE U.S.  NOT ONLY HAD A RIGHT TO DO IT  BUT IS RIGHT TO DO IT. MUCH OF THE WORLD DISAGREES WITH THAT. SEES CONVINCED LIBERALS THIS IS  A SMART POLICY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HUGO, WE HAD LAST WEEK A  FAMILY FROM NORTH WAZIRISTAN,  THEY HAD LOST THEIR GRANDMOTHER  IN A U.S. DRONE STRIKE,  UNACKNOWLEDGED BY THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT, NO REPARATIONS MADE  TO THE FAMILY, DEEPLY IN DEBT  BECAUSE OF MEDICAL EXPENSES. THEY TESTIFIED IN CONGRESS. I THINK WE HAVE A PICTURE OF  WHAT THE ROOM LOOKED LIKE WHEN  THEY TESTIFIED, IT&#39;S BASICALLY  EMPTY. IF YOU LOOK AT DRONES, 66% FAVOR USE OF DRONES, 60% OPPOSE USE OF DRONES, 50% SAY THEY DO NOT KNOW ENOUGH. ON THIS ISSUE, IN MANY WAYS  OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS WON.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ONE, THE TRUTH IS IT&#39;S A  REPRESENTATIVE PICTURE. IT&#39;S TRUE ABOUT HERE ARE THE  STORIES AND THE QUESTION IS HOW  MANY PEOPLE ARE LISTENING,  RIGHT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; RIGHT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE BIGGER QUESTION IS WHAT&#39;S THE STORY THAT WILL GET PEOPLE  TO LISTEN. HOW MANY STORIES WILL GET PEOPLE TO LISTEN. WHAT WILL CHANGE THE CALCULUS. IT&#39;S UNCLEAR. THINK OF AL GORE&#39;S INCONVENIENT  TRUTH, THE POWER OF THAT MOVIE  TEN YEARS AGO AND HOW IT SORT OF GOT A LOT OF TALKING IN THE  MEDIA AND SEEMED LIKE A REALLY  BIG DEAL. 10 YEARS LATER HOW MANY  AMERICANS ARE LIKE GOING CRAZY  ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING. HOW MUCH OF AN IMPACT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE INTRUTH ABOUT THIS ISSUE  IS THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS  DRAMATICALLY DOWNPLAYING THE  NUMBER OF CIVILIANS KILLED. WHEN JOURNALISTS FOLLOW UP AND  GO TO THE SCENE OF THESE HITS,  THE FIRST TIME OBAMA AUTHORIZED  A STRIKE AGAINST YEMEN IN 2009,  THE WHITE HOUSE CLAIMED YEMEN  HAD DONE THE STRIKE. WE KNOW FROM WIKILEAKS CABLES  THAT&#39;S A FLAGRANT LIE, THE U.S.  WAS BEHIND IT. THEY KILLED 36 WOMEN AND  CHILDREN IN THE STRIKE. WHEN I WENT AND INTERVIEWED  SURVIVORS, THEY DESCRIBED THIS  HORRIBLE THING OF THE U.S. HAS  NOT ACKNOWLEDGED THEY KILLED  CIVILIANS. BECAUSE THEY CREATED A MAT MAT  CAL EQUATION, IT RESULTS IN THE  NUMBER ZERO OF CIVILIANS KILLED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ALSO, THE FREQUENCY OF THESE  ATTACKS, JOSH, IN ONE  THREE-MONTH PERIOD YOU REPORT  AMERICAN TROOPS STAGED 1700  NIGHT RAIDS. WE DON&#39;T HEAR ABOUT THAT BUT WE  DO HEAR ABOUT ON FRIDAY A DRONE  STRIKE IN PAKISTAN KILLED A  TALIBAN CHIEF MEHSUD. THAT&#39;S CREATED WITH I WON&#39;T SAY  GREAT CELEBRATION BUT A  POSITIVE. AMERICAN PUBLIC HEARS ABOUT  HIGH-PRIORITY TARGETS ELIMINATED BUT RARELY THE CIVILIAN  CASUALTIES, THE WAY THE DRONE  STRIKES UNDERMINED AMERICAN  CREDIBILITY OVERSEAS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE UNANSWERED QUESTION ABOUT SCOPE ACTUALLY GOES TO THE CASE  THE WHITE HOUSE MAKES ABOUT  THIS. WHEN YOU SAY THIS IS A SMARTER  WAY OF WAGING WAR, YOU CAN  COMPARE IT TO POLICY UNDER BUSH  ADMINISTRATION SEPTEMBER 11th  ATTACKS WHERE WE ENGAGED IN TWO  FULL SCALE GROUND WARS IN IRAQ  AND AFGHANISTAN PUTTING 100,000  AMERICAN TROOPS ON THE GROUND  AND PROBABLY LEADING TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DEATHS IN IRAQ  DUE TO ENSUING CHAOS AND CIVIL  WAR. THIS IS A STRATEGY THAT HAS A  MUCH SMALLER FOOTPRINT THAT I  HAVE TO ASSUME INVOLVES FEWER  CIVILIAN DEATHS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BOOTS ON THE GROUND.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE&#39;RE NOT IN THE HUNDREDS OF  THOUSANDS LIKE IRAQ. THAT&#39;S TRUE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SO THE QUESTION IS IF  MILITARY INTERVENTIONS OF THIS  SORT REALLY ARE NECESSARY, I  THINK THAT&#39;S AN OPEN QUESTION,  ISN&#39;T THIS A SMARTER AND LESS -- &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S A VERY BIG QUESTION,  WHETHER OR NOT MILITARY  INTERVENTIONS LIKE THIS ARE  NECESSARY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; FIRST OF ALL, WE CAN&#39;T LET  OBAMA OFF THE HOOK ON  AFGHANISTAN. OBAMA ESCALATED CONVENTIONAL  WAR, TENS OF THOUSANDS OF  TROOPS, MASSIVE AIRSTRIKES. HE PUT STANLEY McCHRYSTAL, A  COVERT OPERATOR THE JOINT  OPERATIONS MAN IN CHARGE OF AN  ENTIRE THEATER OF WAR AND  TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF CIVILIANS  KILLED IN THE KINDS OF WARS  YOU&#39;RE DESCRIBING THERE. TO ME THE ISSUE ISN&#39;T BECAUSE  OBAMA IS KILLING LESS CIVILIANS  THIS IS A SMART POLICY. WE&#39;RE STILL IN A SITUATION WHERE WE&#39;RE MAKING MORE ENEMIES THAN  KILLING TERRORIST IN THESE  OPERATIONS NOT JUST BECAUSE OF  THE CIVILIANS KILLED. MANY PEOPLE HAVE THE PERCEPTION  WE ARE GRATUITOUS ADVERSARY,  BOMBING VILLAGES AND GOING INTO  COUNTRIES WITHOUT A DECLARED WAR AND CONDUCTING MILITARY  OPERATIONS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I&#39;D LIKE TO ASK JEREMIAH  QUESTION, AS YOU GO AROUND  TALKING TO PEOPLE ABOUT YOUR  MOVIE, YOUR BOOK, PEOPLE IN THE  COUNTRY, WHERE DO YOU SEE THE  TIDE TURNING. STORIES ARE GETTING OUT ABOUT  THE BOMBSINGS. IS THERE A FOOTHOLD OF POPULAR  OPINION IN THE COUNTRY THAT  LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BE CHANGING? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK ONE OF THE  INTERESTING THINGS WITH THE RISE OF THE TEA PARTY BUT ALSO THE  ANTI-WAR, MORE PRINCIPLED  LIBERTARIANS SORT OF CONVERGING  THEIR INTERESTS WITH SOME LEFT  ANTI-WAR FOLKS, I THINK 2016  ELECTION IS GOING TO BE  FASCINATING BECAUSE OF THIS  ISSUE. MY SENSE IS THAT OBAMA SORT OF  CONVINCED A LOT OF LIBERALS TO  CHECK THEIR CONSCIOUSES TECATE  ROOM OF HIS PRESIDENCY ON MANY  OF THESE ISSUES, AND I THINK THE NEXT TIME A REPUBLICAN IS IN  OFFICE AND TRIES TO ASSERT THE  RIGHT TO DO THE VERY THINGS  OBAMA DID, SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE  WILL FIND THEIR CONSCIOUS AGAIN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE QUESTION IS ALSO AS THE  PRESIDENT SAID IN SECOND  INAUGURAL THE WAR IS COMING TO  AN END. THAT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL  QUESTION. GONE FROM 2000 TROOPS IN 2011 AS MUCH AS AS 25,000. YOU QUOTED SAYING WE&#39;VE CREATED  ONE HELL OF A HAMMER. FOR THE REGS OF OUR LIVES WE&#39;LL  BE LOOKING FOR NAILS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; OBAMA, MOST OF THE QUESTION  WAS ON BEYONCE AND LIP-SYNCHING. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LETS ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT  SECOND INAUGURAL WAS PRAISED FOR BEING A RETURN TO PROGRESSIVE  VALUES IN MANY WAYS. IT UNDERSCORES THE SORT OF  PRESIDENCY IN THE CROSSHAIRS  BETWEEN NATIONAL SECURITY POLICY THAT IS IN MANY WAYS A  CONTINUATION OF BUSH  ADMINISTRATION AND DESIRE  DOMESTICALLY TO TURN THE PAGE TO MORE PROGRESSIVE FAR REACHING -- &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I MAJDIC CHENEY FISHING IN  WYOMING ON HIS BOAT SAYING THANK GOD OBAMA DID THIS. IT CLEANED UP FOR THE NEXT TIME  WE&#39;RE IN OFFICE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; A STORY WITHOUT END. JEREMY SCAHILL, DIRTY WARS ON  iTUNES AS WELL AS SOME SCREENS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU TO MY FRIENDS HUGO AND JOSH FOR BEARING WITH ME FOR  THIS ENTIRE SEGMENT.","media$content":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":800000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":500.267,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":360,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/N05f0gowGOxg?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":640,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":500000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":500.267,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":240,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/eS87mgOWROWC?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":420,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":500.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":0,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/MmTEIuHMi63Q?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":0,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"media$thumbnails":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"image","plfile$duration":0.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"JPEG","plfile$height":1080,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_wag_4drone_131104.jpg","plfile$width":1920,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"link":"","pubDate":1383590760000,"plmedia$defaultThumbnailUrl":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_wag_4drone_131104.jpg","nnd$associatedPlaylist":{"href":"http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_52794346"},"nnd$brand":"MSNBC","nnd$bureau":"30RockNY","nnd$bviAssetId":"n_wag_4drone_131104","nnd$canonicalUrl":{"href":"http://www.msnbc.com/now-with-alex-wagner/watch/investigating-americas-covert-war-on-terror-61076035708"},"nnd$distributionProfile":["MSN-CA"],"nnd$firstAiredAtUtc":1383587301000,"nnd$lastAiredAtUtc":1383587301000,"nnd$lastEditorialChangeAtUtc":1383590793000,"nnd$longTitle":"Investigating America’s covert War on Terror","nnd$playCount30":1778,"nnd$playCountDay":160,"nnd$playCountYear":1674,"nnd$requiresCaptioning":true,"nnd$shortDescription":"A decade into the War on Terror drone strikes have become an integral part of American counter-terrorism strategy.

IT&#39;S ABOUT UNDOING THE PROGRESS  THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE THINK WAS  PROGRESS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS WAITING  FOR YOUR CHOICE. I KNOW TOMORROW NIGHT THE PEOPLE OF VIRGINIA WILL SEND A CLEAR  MESSAGE TO OUR COUNTRY AND TO  THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE DON&#39;T WANT OBAMA CARE. WE DON&#39;T WANT BIG GROCHLT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BOTH PARTIES BRINGING IN  BIGWIGS IN VIRGINIA. WHEN THE VOTES ARE COUNTED THERE WILL BE SOME NOTICEABLE  ABSENCES.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Reporter: IT&#39;S OFTEN AN  INVISIBLE BARRIER ACROSS THE  COUNTRY. OVER 5 MILLION AMERICAN ARE  BARRED FROM VOTING BECAUSE THEY  HAVE CRIMINAL RECORDS. ACCORDING TO RECENT ESTIMATES  FROM THE SENTENCING PROJECT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IN TOTALLY CRASS TERMS OF  PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL POLITICS TO  THE MOST RESTRICTIVE RATES OF  VIRGINIA AND FLORIDA WHEN IT  COMES TO FELONY RIGHTS, THESE  ARE PERHAPS TWO OF THE FIVE MOST IMPORTANT STATES THAT DECIDE WHO IS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED  STATES.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Reporter: NBC POLITICAL  DIRECTOR CHUCK TODD KNOWS VOTING HAS BECOME A RIGHT THAT VARIES  DEPENDING WHERE YOU LIVE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE REAL IS WHAT&#39;S GOING ON  IN THE STATES. THIS IS A LARGER PROBLEM WHERE  BASICALLY IF YOU LIVE IN A BLUE  STATE, YOU HAVE ONE SET OF  RIGHTS. IF YOU LIVE IN A RED STATE YOU  HAVE ANOTHER SET OF RIGHTS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHILE ABOUT 14 STATES BAR  INMATES FROM VOTING WHILE  INCARCERAT INCARCERATED. ANOTHER 31 USE RULES THAT DENY  VOTING RIGHTS TO EX-FELONS EVEN  AFTER THEY SERVE TIME. IF THOSE INMATES ALLOWED TO  VOTE, 4.3 MILLION PEOPLE WOULD  BE ADDED TO THE ELECTORATE. THAT&#39;S OVER THREE TIMES THE  MARGIN OF VICTORY IN LAST YEAR&#39;S MIDTERM ELECTIONS TO THE HOUSE,  UNLIKE MANY OTHER BURDENS ON  VOTING, THIS ONE  DISPROPORTIONATELY HURTS  MINORITIES. THE SENTENCING PROJECT ESTIMATES ONE IN EVERY 13 BLACK AMERICANS  IS BARRED FROM VOTING BECAUSE OF A CRIMINAL RECORD.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE STATES THAT HAVE THE  HARSHEST POLICIES JUST HAPPEN TO BE THOSE STATES WITH LEGACIES OF SLAVERY, SEGREGATION,  DISCRIMINATION, VOTER  SUPPRESSION AND THE RIGHT TO  VOTE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; A MAJORITY OF DISIN FRANCHISE RESIDE IN SIX STATES. THE FORMER MAYOR OF NEW ORLEANS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE RIGHT TO SPEECH. THE RIGHT TO FREE EXERCISE OF  WORSHIP AND RELIGION. THE RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS. THE RIGHT TO OWN PROPERTY. WE DON&#39;T DENY ANY OF THOSE RISE  TO THE FORMALLY INCARCERATED  WHICH IS WHY THIS STICKS OUT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS SAID  HE&#39;LL SIGN A BILL TO RESTORE  VOTING RIGHTS TO EX-FELONS, WHAT SOME PROMINENT REPUBLICANS RAND  PAUL AND RICK SANTELORUM. MEANTIME MILLIONS OF EX-CONVICTS ARE BARRED FROM ADVOCATING FOR  THEMSELVES.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. THAT IS A GREAT PIECE. CONGRATULATIONS ON IT. A REALLY TIMELY ONE GIVEN THE  FACT VIRGINIA GUBERNATORIAL RACE ELECTION IS TOMORROW. IT SHOCKED ME THAT 5 -- ALMOST 6 MILLION AMERICANS ARE PROHIBIT  FREDDIE VOTE DUE TO FELONY  RESTRICTIONS. THAT BREAKS DOWN SO SHARPLY  ALONG RACIAL LINES. ONE IN 13 AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN  THE UNITED STATES ARE  DISENFRANCHISED IN LARGE PART  BECAUSE OF THESE FELONY  RESTRICTIONS -- RESTRICTIONS ON  FELONS VOTING. HOW DO WE BEGIN TO -- HOW DO RED STATES OR THE STATES WHERE THIS  IS HAPPENING BEGIN TO EXPLAIN  THIS, THE REASONING, THE RATION RATIONAL BEHIND DENYING THE  VOTE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I DID HARD TO DEFEND THIS. LOOK, WHEN YOU GET OUT OF JAIL,  YOU&#39;VE PAID YOUR DEBT. YOU DON&#39;T HAVE YOUR DUE PROCESS  TAKEN AWAY. YOU DON&#39;T HAVE YOUR RIGHT OF  FREE SPEECH OR RELIGION TAKEN  AWAY. VOTING IS A RIGHT. RAND PAUL SPEAKING AS A  REPUBLICAN FROM A STATE OF  FORMER CONFEDERACY, WHEN HE  LIKENED THIS TO JIM CROW AS HE  DID IN SENATE TESTIMONY AND SOME OTHER REPUBLICANS AS WELL, I  THINK THAT SHOWS THE FACT THAT  IF YOU TALK ABOUT IT, IF YOU GET THIS ON THE AGENDA, IT&#39;S AN  ISSUE WHERE POLITICIANS WANT TO  SOUND LIKE THEY ARE FOR  DEMOCRACY AND NOT THESE RULES  WHICH ARE, A, ANTI-DEMOCRATIC  AND, B, HIGHLY RACIALLY UNFAIR  IN THEIR IMPACT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HUGO, IT&#39;S REALLY HARD TO  STAND UP THERE AND SAY YOU&#39;RE  AGAINST ALLOWING PEOPLE WHO  SERVED THEIR TIME THE RIGHT TO  VOTE. WHAT WAS ONCE THE SEGREGATED  SOUTH, RULES IN EFFECT ONE IN  FIVE BLACK VIRGINIANS WILL BE  UNABLE TO VOTE TOMORROW.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING WHERE MOMENTUM COULD GATHER BEHIND  ROLLING IT BACK. TO ME WHEN I SEE THOSE NUMBERS  THE OTHER THING THAT JUMPS OUT  IS THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE  CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS  ENMESHED, NOT TO TALK ABOUT THE  PULSE AND MILLIONS IN PRISON. MAYBE THIS WILL BE ONE ISSUE  THAT FOCUSES SOME ATTENTION ON  THAT BROKERED PICTURE, TOO.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE FACT THAT RAND PAUL CAME  OUT AND SAID ONE IN THREE BLACK  MALES CONVICTED OF A FELONY AND  LOST VOTING RIGHTS DWARFS ALL  OTHER ISSUES. HAT&#39;S OFF TO RAND PAUL FOR  TAKING AN ISSUE THAT&#39;S PROBABLY  NOT THAT POLITICALLY POPULAR IN  HIS OWN PARTY GIVEN THE  DEMOCRATIC LEANINGS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I DON&#39;T THINK THIS IS AN  ISSUE A LOT OF REPUBLICANS HAVE  STRONG OPINIONS ON, SO I THINK  IT&#39;S SOMETHING RAND PAUL CAN  BREAK WITH HIS PARTY A BIT. IT FITS IN WITH HIS OVERALL  LIBERTARIAN VIEWPOINT. I DON&#39;T THINK HE&#39;LL PAY A PRICE. HE RAISES A GOOD POINT. ONE IN FIVE BLACK ADULTS IN  VIRGINIA IS DISENFRANCHISED AS A CONVICTED FLOWN. IT&#39;S OUTRAGEOUS YOU HAVE THAT  LEVEL OF DISENFRANCHISEMENT,  IT&#39;S ALSO OUTRAGEOUS ONE IN FIVE BLACK ADULTS IN VIRGINIA IS A  FLOWN. POINTS TO THE EXTENSIVENESS OF  DRUG WAR, VAST  OVERCRIMINALIZATION OF  NONVIOLENT ACTIVITY IN THE  UNITED STATES. WE SHOULD EXTEND VOTING RIGHTS  BUT ALSO SEND FEWER PEOPLE TO  PRISON FOR ALL SORTS OF REASONS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; MAJOR FLAWS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; EXACTLY. WE&#39;VE HAD A PRISON POPULATION  THAT INCREASED MORE THAN FIVE  FOLD, RISING UP TO 2010 WHEN IT  DECREASED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN  A GENERATION. WHAT THIS DOES, THE TITLE OF THE SERIES IS PRESUMED GUILTY  BECAUSE WE LOOK AT SYSTEMICALLY  UNDER THE DATA HOW THE CRIMINAL  JUSTICE SYSTEM TENDS TO BE MORE  LIKELY TO PRESUME THE GUILT OF  AFRICAN-AMERICANS THAN ANY OTHER POPULATION AT EVERY STAGE. THAT COMES FROM PROFILING AND  HOW WE DEAL WITH SUSPECTS TO HOW WE DEAL WITH PEOPLE IN THE  SYSTEM AND INCARCERATION TO HOW  WE DEAL WITH THEM WHEN THEY GET  OUT. THE OTHER POINT CAME UP IN THE  1974 SUPREME COURT CASE THAT  UPHELD THIS PRACTICE. THE OTHER POINT IS A LOT OF  PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN  REHABILITATION BELIEVE WHEN  PEOPLE COME OUT OF PRISON WE  HAVE TO REINTEGRATE THEM INTO  SOCIETY. PUBLIC LIFE, CIVIC LIFE,  ECONOMIC LIFE. THE IDEA THAT WE ARE HOLDING  THEM BACK FROM THIS ROLE, FROM  PARTICIPATING IN OUR DEMOCRACY  IS REALLY PROBLEMATIC FOR THE  THING EVERYONE, LIBERALS AND  CONSERVATIVES SAY WE WANT TO DO, FOLLOW THE LAW.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I HAVE A QUESTION. WHEN YOU&#39;RE PUTTING THIS REPORT  TOGETHER YOU YOU FIND SOMEBODY  WHO SAYS, NO, WE&#39;VE GOT TO KEEP  THESE KINDS OF RESTRICTIONS IN  PLACE, IMPORTANT TO PRESERVING  THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. WHO IS THE ADVOCATE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I QUOTE IN THE ARTICLE  ONLINE, HE TALKS ABOUT THE IDEA  THERE ARE CERTAIN RIGHTS YOU  SACRIFICE IF YOU DO MISCONDUCT. THAT&#39;S HIS ARGUMENT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THERE ARE MANY WHO ARE  SACRIFICING.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ARI&#39;S IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS FOR  EX-FELONS IS UP ON MSNBC.COM  RIGHT NOW.

THIS IS THE SECOND PART OF THAT  INTERVIEW. I ASKED 14-YEAR-OLD ABOUT HIS  FEELING ABOUT THE UNITED STATES  IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE DRONE  STRIKE THAT KILLED HIS  GRANDMOTHER.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Translator: MY FRIENDS WERE  TELLING ME I SHOULD NOT EXACTLY  COME TO AMERICA BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE DONE THIS TO  ME. I THOUGHT THEY MUST BE PEOPLE  LIKE US. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING I SHOULD  TAKE OUT AGAINST AMERICANS BUT  THEIR GOVERNMENT. NOW THAT I&#39;M HERE I SEE  AMERICANS ARE VERY NICE PEOPLE,  RESPECTFUL AND TREAT ME LIKE A  HUMAN BEING. ALL I REQUEST IS THEY END THESE  DRONES SO I CAN ALSO LIVE IN A  PEACEFUL COUNTRY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NABILA, WHEN YOU GO OUTSIDE  AND PLAY, ARE YOU SCARED OR HOW  DO YOU FEEL ABOUT GOING OUTSIDE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Translator: I USED TO GO  OUTSIDE AND PLAY. NOW I DON&#39;T GO OUT AND PLAY  BECAUSE I&#39;M SCARED.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU HAD BAD BURNS. HOW WAS THAT RECOVERY PROCESS? WAS IT DIFFICULT FOR YOU? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I WAS HURT ON MY HANDS. THERE WAS A LOT OF BLOOD. A LOT OF BLOOD CAME OUT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I WANT TO ASK, YOUR CHILDREN  ARE HERE. IT&#39;S A WONDERFUL THING THEY ARE  HERE TO TALK ABOUT THIS. YOUR FAMILY HAS SUSTAINED A LOT  OF TRAUMA. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE UNITED  STATES, I&#39;M SURE THERE&#39;S A LOT  OF ANGER AND FRUSTRATION. I WOULD ASK ABOUT PAKISTAN AND  HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THESE CASES  WHERE THEY HAVE ALLOWED THESE TO HAPPEN.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I WAS UPSET WITH AMERICA. I KNOW THEY DID NOT  INTENTIONALLY DO THIS I DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHY MY  CHILDREN ENDED UP GETTING HURT  AND MY MOTHER DIED. ALL I WANT FOR MY CHILDREN AND  HOPE FOR THEM IS THEY CAN LIVE  IN A PEACEFUL ENVIRONMENT AND  COMPLETE THEIR EDUCATION. NOW THEY LIVE IN FEAR, CONSTANT  FEAR. I&#39;M AWARE PAKISTANI AND AMERICAN GOVERNMENT MAY BE AWARE OF THESE DRONES HAPPENING AND I FEEL THE  PAKISTANI GOVERNMENT HAS FAILED  ME BECAUSE I&#39;M A CITIZEN OF THAT COUNTRY. AS A CITIZEN, THEIR DUTY IS TO  PROTECT ME. I FEEL A BIT NEGLECTED. OBVIOUSLY I JUST DON&#39;T  UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT WHAT I DO WANT IS THAT THESE TWO GOVERNMENTS FIND A WAY TO  BRING PEACE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD,  EITHER BY DISCUSSION AND ENDING  THESE DRONES SO WE DON&#39;T HAVE TO LIVE IN FEAR ANY LONGER.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; JENNIFER, I&#39;D LIKE TO ASK YOU A QUESTION. IN TERMS OF THIS CONVERSATIONAL  VOID TO LET THIS FAMILY TELL  THEIR STORY WHICH IS HIGHLY  UNDERDISCUSSED IN TERMS OF THE  CASUALTIES FROM THESE DRONE  STRIKES, DO YOU EXPECT THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT -- HOW OPTIMISTIC ARE YOU THIS POLICY CAN CHANGE. THIS POLICY OF DRONE STRIKES  SEEM TO BE WORKING QUITE WELL  FOR PARTS OF THE  COUNTER-TERRORISM COMMUNITY. WHAT&#39;S YOUR FEELING NOW THAT THE FAMILY HAS BEEN IN THE UNITED  STATES AND TOLD THIS STORY? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK WE&#39;RE VERY  OPTIMISTIC. WE&#39;RE OPTIMISTIC IF YOU PUT A  HUMAN FACE ON THE NUMBERS AND  THIS DEBATE, ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IT&#39;S BEEN NUMBERS UP TO THIS  POINT. NUMBERS AND POLICY WITHOUT  ANYONE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THOSE NUMBERS REPRESENT PEOPLE LIKE  RAFIQ, NABILA AND ZUBAIR. THE HOPE IS THAT YOU PUT A FACE  TO THE NUMBERS AND PEOPLE IN  WASHINGTON START LISTENING. IS THIS REALLY THE POLICY WE  SHOULD BE PURSUING.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I WANT TO SAY WE&#39;RE VERY  HAPPY TO HAVE YOU IN THE STATES  TELLING YOUR STORY. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF US TO LET YOU KNOW THAT ALL AMERICANS  CONSENT TO THIS POLICY.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt;&gt; COMING UP, IF YOU NEED ANY  MORE EVIDENCE AS TO WHY JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS ARE SO IMPORTANT,  LOOK NO FURTHER THAN TEXAS FIFTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS WHICH  YESTERDAY RULED IN FAVOR OF  REINSTATING A HIGHLY RESTRICTIVE AND CONTROVERSIAL ABORTION LAW.

THE BATTLE HAS BEEN LARGELY A  FACELESS ONE. THAT CHANGED THIS WEEK. FOR THE FIRST TIME CONGRESS  HEARD DIRECT TESTIMONY FROM  SURVIVORS OF AN ALLEGED U.S.  DRONE STRIKE IN PAKISTAN. AT A HEARING ORGANIZED BY ALAN  GRAYSON. A PAKISTANI SCHOOL TEACHER AND  HIS 9-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER AND  13-YEAR-OLD SON TESTIFIED ABOUT  THE DAY THEIR GRANDMOTHER WAS  KILLED IN A U.S. DRONE STRIKE IN WAZIRISTAN, THE SAME LOCATION AS YESTERDAYED STRIKE AND TERRORIST ENCLAVE. IT HAPPENED OCTOBER 24th, 2012. MILAN, A, A 67-YEAR-OLD MID  WE&#39;VE WAS TENDING TO HER GARDEN  WHEN SHE WAS STRUCK AND KILLED  BY A U.S. DRONE. HER GRANDCHILDREN, THOSE  TESTIFYING, WERE AMONG VICTIMS  OF THE ATTACK. HER BODY WAS TOO BADLY BURNED TO RUN AWAY. HER BROTHER WAS FORCED TO  UNDERGO SURGERY AND SPECIAL  MEDICAL TREATMENT TO REMOVE  CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF SHRAPNEL  IN HIS LEG. THE FAMILY HAS FAILED TO RECEIVE ANY ACKNOWLEDGEMENT U.S. FORCES  WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR HER DEATH  NOR HAVE THEY RECEIVED  COMPENSATION FOR LOSS. NEW REPORTS FROM UNITED NATIONS, HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH AND AMNESTY  INTERNATIONAL DOCUMENT THE HUMAN COST OF DRONE STRIKES AND DEMAND MORE ACCOUNTABILITY. YESTERDAY PAKISTAN&#39;S GOVERNMENT  CLAIMED U.S. DRONES TOOK THE  LIVES OF 67 CIVILIANS SINCE  2008, A FIGURE FAR LOWER THAN  EARLIER ESTIMATES. THIS WEEK I SPOKE WITH THE  FAMILY AND ASKED 13-YEAR-OLD  ZUBA WHAT HAPPENED.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT WAS THE DAY BEFORE EID. I HAD GOTTEN HOME FROM SCHOOL. I PRAYED AND HAD A SNACK AND MY  GRANDMOTHER ASKED ME TO HELP HER IN THE FIELDS. WE WERE PREPARING VEGETABLES FOR THE MEAL TOMORROW. WHILE WE WERE OUTSIDE WITH OUR  GRANDMOTHER I HEARD A NOISE AND  SAW TWO MISSILES COME DOWN WITH  MY GRANDMOTHER STANDING BY ME. EVERYTHING TURNED DARK. I HEARD A SCREAM. THE NEXT THING I KNEW I WAS  RUNNING BECAUSE I WAS SO SCARED. LATER I FOUND OUT MY GRANDMOTHER WAS BLOWN UP INTO PIECES. THERE&#39;S PAIN IN MY LEFT LEG. IT WAS AS IF I WAS ON FIRE. I COULD FEEL BLOOD COMING OUT. DESPISED THE PAIN I TRIED TO RUN OUT OF THERE. FIVE MINUTES LATER I HEARD THE  SAME DUMB DUMB NOISE AND  MISSILES CAME DOWN. I HEARD LATER THIS IS A TACTIC  THAT WAS USED THAT WHOEVER IN  THE HOUSE WOULD COME OUTSIDE. MY COUSINS IN THE HOUSE CAME OUT AFTER HEARING THE FIRST ATTACK. IN TOTAL NINE CHILDREN IN MY  FAMILY HAD BEEN INJURED AS A  RESULT OF THIS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NABILA, DID YOU KNOW WHAT A  DRONE WAS? HAD YOU SEEN ONE BEFORE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Translator: THEY ARE ALWAYS  THERE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ARE CHILDREN IN THE  NEIGHBORHOOD AFRAID OF THEM? WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THEM? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Translator: BEFORE IT WAS  SOMETHING NORMAL TO US. WE WOULD ALWAYS HEAR IT. AFTER THE ATTACK THEY SAW MY  GRANDMA GOT KILLED AND WE WERE  INJURED, MY FRIENDS TELL ME  WE&#39;RE SCARED NOW. THIS COULD HAPPEN TO US.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NINE CHILDREN IN YOUR FAMILY  WERE INJURED IN THIS ATTACK. WHAT WAS YOUR IMMEDIATE  REACTION? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Translator: NOW LOOKING BACK  AT IT, I CAN&#39;T MAKE SENSE OF IT. I STILL DON&#39;T UNDERSTAND. WE&#39;RE A FAMILY OF EDUCATORS. I&#39;M A TEACHER. MY FATHER WAS THE RETIRED  PRINCIPAL OF THE SCHOOL WHERE I  TEACH. MY MOTHER, ALTHOUGH SHE MIGHT  NOT HAVE BEEN EDUCATED SHE  SERVED AS A MID WIFE IN OUR  VILLAGE. ALL WE WANT IS PEACE AND TO SEND OUR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IS THIS SOMETHING THAT&#39;S  HAPPENED TO OTHER FAMILIES THAT  YOU KNOW OF? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I&#39;VE HEARD OF INCIDENTS LIKE  THIS, BUT IT&#39;S NEVER BEEN  SOMEONE I PERSONALLY HAVE KNOWN. UNFORTUNATELY WE&#39;RE ALL POOR  PEOPLE AND WE DON&#39;T HAVE THE  OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR  STORIES. EVEN IF WE DID, IT&#39;S NOT AS IF  MANY PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR IT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE  INJURIES SUSTAINED BY ZUBAR, HE  WAS BADLY INJURED WITH SHRAPNEL. HAS ANYBODY HELPED PAY FOR THE  MEDICAL BILLS BECAUSE OF THE  INJURIES.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Translator: THE WHOLE REASON  I CONSIDERED WRITING TO MY  GOVERNMENT, HE NEEDED A SURGERY  THAT WAS VERY EXPENSIVE. I&#39;M A POOR PERSON. I COOPERATE AFFORD IT. THEY SAID WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU  IS VERY SAD AND UNFORTUNATE BUT  THIS IS A RESULT OF AN AMERICAN  DRONE. THAT&#39;S WHY I&#39;VE TAKEN OUT DRONES AND I&#39;M IN DEBT FOR HIS SURGERY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I&#39;D LIKE TO ASK YOU IN TERMS  OF GETTING THE FAMILY TO THE  UNITED STATES, HOW DIFFICULT WAS THAT GIVEN HOW MUCH THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN RETICENT TO  ACKNOWLEDGE THERE HAVE BEEN  CIVILIAN TOLLS IN DRONE STRIKES  AND THE THORNINESS OF GETTING  PAPERS TO COME INTO THE U.S.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT HASN&#39;T BEEN EASY. IT&#39;S PROBABLY ABOUT A SIX-MONTH  PROCESS IN THIS POINT. FOR PEOPLE LIVING IN THIS AREA,  ONE OF THE BIGGEST IMPEDIMENTS  AS A STARTING POINT IS GETTING  BIRTH CERTIFICATES. IT&#39;S NOT STANDARD TO GET BIRTH  CERTIFICATES WHEN THEY ARE BORN. SO WE HAD TO START FROM THE VERY BEGINNING IN TRYING TO GET THEM  PAPERWORK OF A BIRTH CERTIFICATE TO EVEN BE ABLE TO GET THE  PASSPORT TO EVEN THEN BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR THE VISA. IT WAS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY  THE FACT THE FAMILY WAS SUPPOSED TO TRAVEL WITH ME AND THEIR  PAKISTANI LAWYER WHO IS A LEGAL  FELLOW WHO WORKS CLOSELY WITH  OVER 150 FAMILIES WHO HAVE BEEN  AFFECTED BY DRONE STRIKES. THE U.S. REFUSED TO GRANT HIS  VISA. WE THEN HAD TO SCRAMBLE TO  FIGURE OUT ANOTHER WAY TO GET  THEM HERE. WHAT HAPPENED WAS I FLEW TO  ISLAMABAD TO GET THEM HERE AND  THEN D.C.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; COMING UP I ASKED WHAT HE AS  A YOUNG MAN THINKS ABOUT THE  UNITED STATES.

THAT IS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WERE ABLE TO ENROLL IN INSURANCE PLAN THROUGH THE HEALTHCARE.GOV  WEBSITE ON LAUNCH DAY ACCORDING  TO DOCUMENTS OR WAR ROOM NOTES  RELEASED ON THURSDAY NIGHT. BY THE END OF THE SECOND DAY  ONLY 248 PEOPLE IN THE ENTIRE  COUNTRY HAD ENROLLED EVEN THOUGH ESTIMATES SHOW 40,000 PEOPLE IN  THE ONLINE WAITING ROOM. ACCORDING TO THE WHITE HOUSE  ESTIMATE 4.7 UNIQUE VISITORS  VISITED THE WEBSITE WAYNE THE  FIRST 24 HOURS OF ENROLLMENT. LAST NIGHT THE DEPARTMENT OF  HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PUSHED BACK ON THE LEAKED REPORT. SPEAKING TO NBC NEWS, &quot;THESE  APPEAR TO BE NOTES. THEY DO NOT INCLUDE OFFICIAL  ENROLLMENT STATISTICS. WE ARE FOCUSED ON PROVIDING  REALABLE AND ACCURATE  INFORMATION AND WE DO NOT HAVE  THAT AT THIS TIME. WE HAVE ALWAYS ANTICIPATED THE  PACE OF ENROLLMENT WILL INCREASE THROUGHOUT THE ENROLLMENT  PERIOD. JOINING US NOW IS MELISSA  HARRIS-PERRY WITH HER ECONOMIST  SHOW.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I&#39;M SUPPOSED TO SPEAK TO THIS QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER IT WAS  SIX PEOPLE OR 250. I HAVE NO IDEA HOW MANY PEOPLE  SIGNED UP.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HERE IS A THEORY I&#39;M  FLOATING. THEY SHOULD JUST SAY, HOW DO  THESE SIX PEOPLE GET THROUGH. THEY ARE THE GLITCHES.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S NOT A SMALL POINT. WE JUST SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE OF ANGERED IRRITATION  OVER THE IDEA THAT ANY AMERICAN  WOULD HAVE TO SIGN UP FOR OBAMA  CARE. THEN THE FIRST ACT OF GOVERNMENT AFTER REOPENING IS TO HAVE  HEARINGS ABOUT THE FACT PEOPLE  CAN&#39;T SIGN UP FOR THE THING,  THIS ENTIRE BLOCKADE AGAINST. FEELS WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS HAVING A CHALLENGE WITH, A  CAPACITY TO SELL THIS PROGRAM,  WHICH HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH  THE FACT THERE ARE VERY REAL  BENEFICIARIES OF THE ACA  EXPANSION MOST IMPORTANTLY  AROUND MEDICAID. BUT WE GET TO THAT CONVERSATION  BECAUSE WE&#39;RE TALKING ABOUT THE  GLITCHES IN THE WEBSITE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; MAY I REMIND US THIS  INFORMATION COMES FROM A LEAKED  REPORT FROM NONE OTHER THAN  DARRELL ISSA. I&#39;M GOING TO SAY HE&#39;S GOT A  LITTLE HISTORY OF CHERRY PICKING THE INFORMATION HE LEAKS. WE SAW THAT IN THE IRS SCANDAL  WHERE EVERYBODY WENT THIS  DIRECTION. WE GET THE FACTS AND REALIZE  IT&#39;S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT STORY  THAN WE THOUGHT. I WANT TO REMIND US, THERE HAVE  BEEN PLENTY OF GLITCHES. WE THINK IT&#39;S TERRIBLE. I&#39;M NOT SURE WE SHOULD USE  DARRELL ISSA.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; A DISCOUNT FACTOR OF 25 AT  LEAST.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SO 31 PEOPLE SIGNED UP. GLEN, GO AHEAD.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; DARRELL ISSA ASIDE, THIS IS  NOT GOING WELL.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; MASTER OF UNDERSTATEMENT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I WOULD JUST LIKE TO POINT  OUT THAT EVEN DARRELL ISSA  OCCASIONALLY MANAGES TO GET -- I THINK THIS WAS ACTUALLY A FAIRLY REVEALING DOCUMENT. HSS, MY REPORTING AND OTHERS WAS PATHETIC.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CAN WE HAVE THAT NEW YORKER? I DON&#39;T KNOW IF HE WAS USING A  GORDON GEKKO PHONE AS HE CALLED  HSS BUT THE LACK OF PREPAREDNESS AND COORDINATION. THAT SAID, SAM, THE GOLD  STANDARD OF HEALTH CARE POLLERS, THE GOLD STANDARD OF HEALTH CARE POLLING, KAISER ASKS AMERICANS  WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE  CONGRESS DO WHEN IT COMES TO  HEALTH CARE? 47% OF RESPONDENTS WANT TO  EXPAND OR KEEP IT, 37% WANT TO  REPEAL IT. THOSE NUMBERS ARE SORT OF  EXEMPLARY OF THE FACT THAT  AMERICANS DO NOT THINK GOP HAS  AN ALTERNATIVE FOR OBAMA CARE  AND THEY WOULD RATHER WORK  THROUGH THIS MESSY, GLITCHY  SEMIDISASTER TO GET TO BETTER  HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR  EVERYONE THAN WALK EVERYTHING  BACK.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; DOESN&#39;T GOP HAVE AN  ALTERNATIVE? I KNOW THEY THROW OUT SOME  IDEAS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THEY DON&#39;T. THAT IS WIDELY UNDERSTOOD.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THERE&#39;S AN AMBIGUOUS WHAT IF, WHAT IF WE HAD TO START OVER  FROM SCRATCH, WOULD ANYTHING GET DONE. PEOPLE ARE FRIGHTENED NOTHING  WOULD. THERE&#39;S BEEN INCREDIBLE  GLITCHES. I THOUGHT THE DOCUMENT WAS  REVEALING. I WAS GLAD IT WAS RELEASED. I&#39;M PRETTY SURE IT&#39;S GOING TO  RAMP UP FROM SIX TO 248 TO A  BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS IF THE  MASSACHUSETTS MODEL IS CORRECT. HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT JUST A  DEBATE ABOUT ENROLLMENT BUT A  HUGE SYSTEM FAILING THE AMERICAN PUBLIC PRIOR TO THAT. PEOPLE&#39;S MEMORIES AREN&#39;T  SHORT-TERM BUT LONG-TERM. THEY UNDERSTAND THE INDIVIDUAL  MARKETPLACE IS A COMPLETE  DISASTER AND NEEDS TO BE  REFORMED. WHILE THERE ARE HORROR STORIES  DOMINATING THE NEWS NOW, IN  EIGHT MONTH&#39;S TIME, 12 MONTH&#39;S  TIME YOU&#39;RE GOING TO SEE A LOT  OF PEOPLE SAYING, WOW, THESE  REFORMS WERE PROBABLY GOOD FOR  THE SYSTEM.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I&#39;M NOT SURE I QUITE AGREE  NOTHING WOULD GET DONE. THEY DO HAVE ALTERNATIVES. REPUBLICANS HAVE ALTERNATIVES. THE ALTERNATIVES LEAVE MORE  PEOPLE, MANY HUNDREDS OF  THOUSANDS --  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE TAKE THEM AT THEIR WORD ON WHAT THEY PROPOSE. THAT&#39;S THE BEST WE&#39;VE GOT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE --  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; STATUS QUO --  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE  STUCK IN THE ONLINE WAITING ROOM THAN THE REALITIES OF MANY  MILLIONS THROWN OFF OF MEDICAID. WE&#39;RE ALREADY SEEING THE CLEAR  WILLINGNESS OF REPUBLICAN STATE  LAWMAKERS TO REFUSE MEDICATION  EXPANSION TO THE NEEDIEST  MEMBERS OF THEIR CONSTITUENCIES  ONCE THEY WERE GIVEN THAT OPTION BY THE ROBERTS COURT. EVEN IF THIS COULDN&#39;T GET  THROUGH THE PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL  WE SEE WILLINGNESS TO WITHHOLD  HEALTH CARE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE FOCUS HAS BEEN ON HEALTH  CARE ABOUT POSSES BEING  CANCELED. THERE WILL COME A TIME WHEN THEY START ASKING POOR PEOPLE IN RED  STATES WHO COULD HAVE APPLIED  FOR MEDICARE WHAT IT WAS LIKE  NOT TO BE ABLE TO GET ACCESS TO  INSURANCE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOBODY HAS A PROGRAM, AN  OPTION.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LET ME ASK YOU, THERE ARE  SEVERAL COMPETING AREAS HERE. I&#39;M OF THE MIND THE WEBSITE WILL GET FIXED HOPEFULLY BY NOVEMBER  30th. I THINK THE REPUBLICANS ARE  GRADUALLY ACCEPTING THAT IDEA AS WELL. THEY ARE LOSING THIS IDEA OF  PEOPLE LOSING THEIR INSURANCE. AS KEY ADVISERS NOTED THOSE  PLANS WERE CRAPPY TO BEGIN WITH. BUT THEY ARE GOING TO CONTINUE  TO GET HAMMERED ON THIS ISSUE OF CREDIBILITY AND TRUSTWORTHY. JAY CARNEY PUNTED THIS QUESTION  OVER THE INSURANCE MARKET AND  SAID, THE PROBLEM, WHICH HAS  ALWAYS BEEN THE PROBLEM,  INSURANCE COMPANIES IN THAT  WILD, WILD WEST OF THE INSURANCE MARKET COULD ARBITRARILY CANCEL, CHANGE, DOWNGRADE THOSE PLANS AT ANY TIME AND MANY OF THEM HAVE  OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. THAT&#39;S TRUE. BUT IT&#39;S NOT LIKE THE WHITE  HOUSE DIDN&#39;T KNOW.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BY THE WAY, I DON&#39;T RECALL  THAT BEING THE APPLAUSE LINE IN  THE 500 SPEECHES I HAD TO SIT  THROUGH. I MEAN, THIS IS CLEARLY THEY  WERE EITHER MISLEADING OR  WEREN&#39;T QUITE AWARE OF IT. I DON&#39;T KNOW WHAT THE HECK IT  WAS. THE THING I FIND INCREDIBLY  STRIKING HERE, THE PRESIDENT  KEEPS TELLING US HOW ANGRY HE  IS. HE HASN&#39;T TOLD US HE SCREWED UP. AT SOME POINT DOWN THE LINE  PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WANT TO HEAR WHY HE DIDN&#39;T OVERSEE THE SYSTEM MORE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IF HE DOES THAT, HE CAN  REALLY ONLY DO THAT ONCE THIS  THING IS REALLY WORKING WELL  WHICH COULD BE MONTHS AND MONTHS FROM NOW.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOR DO I THINK IT MAKES GOOD  SENSE OR POLITICS. THIS PRESIDENT IS NOT RUNNING  FOR RE-ELECTION. WHAT HE DOES HAVE TO DO IS  PROTECT THE PARTY WHICH HAS A  REAL CAPACITY TO EXTEND ITS  GROWTH IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE  IN THE NEXT ELECTION CYCLE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SOMEONE HAS TO BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT HAPPENED HERE. I&#39;LL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. FINE. IN ADDITION TO ME SOMEONE ELSE  SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. THIS WAS HIS SIGNATURE POLICY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE AMERICAN PEOPLE  RE-ELECTED HIM BASED ON THIS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS A BIG, BIG F UP  BASICALLY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHEW.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW --  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE STILL HAVE TO HOLD SOMEONE ACCOUNTABLE FOR A WEBSITE --  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; FOR A WEBSITE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YES.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE&#39;RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE A BREAK. I&#39;LL JUST SAY NOBODY HAS BEEN  HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE  FINANCIAL CALAMITY. I QUESTION WHETHER THAT IS  ACTUALLY GOING TO HAPPEN AND  WHETHER IT WILL REALLY FIX  ANYTHING. I JUST THINK WHAT WE ARE MORE  LIKELY TO SEE IS GET MORE -- AND RESIGN.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT PERSON WANTED AND NEEDED INSURANCE. THE REASON ONLY SIX PEOPLE  ENROLLED WAS BECAUSE OF  FAILURES.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT IS FAIR. THERE IS A HUMAN COST TO ALL OF  THIS. WE MUST TAKE A BREAK.

YESTERDAY SENATE REPUBLICAN  FILIBUSTERED NOMINATIONS OF  PATRICIA MALLET AND REPRESENTATIVE WATT. HISTORY BUFFS, THE FIRST MEMBER  OF CONGRESS TO BE FILIBUSTERED  SINCE THE YEAR 1843. DEMOCRATS AND OTHER LOVERS OF A  FUNCTIONING U.S. GOVERNMENT WERE NOT PLEASED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE VERY DEEPLY THAT  THE JUDICIARY IS TOO IMPORTANT  TO PLAY PARTISAN GAMES WITH IT. THAT&#39;S EXACTLY WHAT&#39;S GOING ON  HERE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; GOING TO HOLD NOMINATIONS  HOSTAGE WITHOUT CONSIDERATION OF INDIVIDUAL MERIT WE WILL HAVE  DRASTIC MEASURES.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; DRASTIC MEASURES ALSO KNOWN  AS THE NUCLEAR OPTION, ALSO  KNOWN AS A PUSH TO GET NOMINEES  CLEARED WITH A SIMPLE 51-VOTE  MAJORITY. DEMOCRATS ARE RECONSIDERING THAT MEASURE BECAUSE OF THE GOP&#39;S  UNPRECEDENTED AND HISTORIC  INTRANSIGENCE ON, WELL,  EVERYTHING BUT ESPECIALLY ON  PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATIONS. AS &quot;THE NEW YORK TIMES&quot; REPORTS, REPUBLICAN OBJECTIONS TO MISS  MILLET HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH  HER POLITICAL LEANINGS. THEY WANTED TO REFUSE PRESIDENT  OBAMA ANY MORE APPOINTMENTS TO  APPEALS COURT. THAT&#39;S BECAUSE THE COURT  OVERSEES MOST AGENCIES, HEALTH  CARE, FINANCIAL REFORM TO THE  IRS AND EPA. UNDERSCORING THE IMPORTANCE OF  THE D.C. CIRCUIT COURT, FOUR OF  THE NINE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES  SERVED ON IT. BUT RATHER THAN THAN ADMIT TO  THEIR FEAR OBAMA APPOINTEE MIGHT SHIFT THE BALANCE AWAY FROM  THEM, REPUBLICANS HAVE COOKED UP A SKETCHY, MOSTLY ABSURD  ARGUMENT THAT FILLING AN EMPTY  SEAT AMOUNTS TO COURT PACKING. BECAUSE YOU KNOW, THE SECOND  MOST IMPORTANT COURT IN THE LAND IS NOT BUSY. WHY DO THEY NEED ALL THOSE  JUDGES ANYWAY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; PRESENTLY THERE&#39;S ENOUGH  JUDGES TO GO AROUND. THERE&#39;S PLENTY OF REASONS NOT TO FILL ANY MORE SEATS ON THIS  COURT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HE&#39;S TRYING TO PACK THE COURT IN ORDER TO AFFECT THE OUTCOMES. IF YOU&#39;RE GOING TO TRY TO JAM  THREE ADDITIONAL JUDGES ON THE  COURT THAT ARE NOT NEEDED,  SECOND MOST IMPORTANT COURT IN  THE NATION TO CHANGE THE OUTCOME OF DECISIONS AND RUBBER STAMP  THE ADMINISTRATION&#39;S EXPANSIVE  POLICIES, I DON&#39;T KNOW WHAT ELSE YOU&#39;D CALL IT OTHER THAN COURT  PACKING.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT. NOMINATIONS FOR EMPTY COURT  SEATS ARE TANTAMOUNT TO JAMMING  THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. NOT ONLY DOES THIS REPUBLICAN  OBSTRUCTION CREATE HAVOC, IT HAS THE ADDED BONUS OF UNDERMINING  CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY OF THE  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. IN REALITY, IF ANYONE IS COURT  PACKING, IT&#39;S ACTUALLY SENATE  REPUBLICANS. WRITES SALON, REPUBLICANS ARE  DENYING OR THREATENING TO DENY  CONFIRMATION TO ANY NOMINEES IN  ORDER TO NULLIFY LAWS, STYMY  LEGITIMATE POLICYMAKING AND  REVERSE PAC, KEEP LIBERAL JUDGES OFF ONE KEY APPELLATE COURT IN  ORDER TO CONSERVE ITS  CONSERVATIVE BALANCE FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. JOINING ME TODAY SENIOR WRITER  FOR &quot;POLITICO&quot; MAGAZINE GLEN  THRUSH, HOST OF DISRUPT KAREN  FINNEY AND WRITER FROM THE  &quot;WASHINGTON POST&quot; SAM STEIN. WONDERFUL PEOPLE. THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME THIS  FRIDAY OF FRIDAYS. GLEN HAS MORE TIME WITH THESE  SLACKY MAGAZINE DEADLINES.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; PACKED THE COURT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE HAVE TALKED. I THINK THERE&#39;S NEW POLLING OUT. THERE&#39;S A DISCUSSION ABOUT BOTH  PARTIES BEING AT ONCE HURT BY  RECENT SORT OF SCANDALS,  ALLEGATIONS, PROBLEMS, AND  GAINING GROUND ON OTHER PARTIES  BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS ON THE  OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE. THIS REPUBLICAN WAVE OF  OBSTRUCTION THAT WE SAW IN AND  AROUND RAISING THE DEBT CEILING  AND REOPENING THE GOVERNMENT  CONTINUES IN I THINK A MORE  INSIDIOUS WAY WITH THESE  NOMINATIONS. I WONDER, GLEN, HARRY REID  TALKED ABOUT THE NUCLEAR OPTION, WHICH IS USING SIMPLE MAJORITY  TO CLEAR NOMINEES. THAT WAS PUT DOWN AS IT WERE. SOME CONCESSIONS WERE MADE. DO YOU THINK DEMOCRATS AFTER ALL OF THE BATTLES THAT HAVE BEEN  WAGED IN THE LAST TWO MONTHS  THROW THEIR HANDS UP AND SAY,  YOU KNOW WHAT, IT&#39;S TIME TO USE  THE NUCLEAR OPTION.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ANY TIME REPUBLICANS AREN&#39;T  TALKING ABOUT OBAMA CARE ROLLOUT IN THE DEBACLE THEY ARE LOSING. IT&#39;S INTERESTING TO ME THEY  WOULD DECIDE TO PICK THIS FIGHT  RIGHT AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT  IN TIME. THERE&#39;S A NUMBER OF REASONS WHY  THEY ARE DOING THIS. THE FIRST IS YOU&#39;VE GOT A LOT OF REPUBLICANS UP IN CYCLE. WHEN YOU&#39;RE TALKING ABOUT  LINDSEY GRAHAM TALKING ABOUT  BLOCKING JANET YELLIN. THAT IS CLEARLY IN-STATE  POLITICS THEY ARE DOING. I THINK IT&#39;S NUTS FOR THEM TO  CREATE, GIVE DEMOCRATS THE  OPPORTUNITY TO SOAPBOX ON AN  ISSUE WHEN ALL THE REPUBLICANS  RIGHT NOW FROM A POLITICAL  PERSPECTIVE SHOULD BE TALKING  ABOUT IS OBAMA CARE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S REALLY ALMOST A BRIDGE  TOO FAR. THE IDEA THAT THE PRESIDENT BY  FILLING THE SEATS AS HE IS  SUPPOSED TO DO AS PRESIDENT OF  THE UNITED STATES IS SOMEHOW  OBSTRUCTING JUSTICE,  MANIPULATING EXECUTIVE POWER. I DO THINK IT&#39;S A BRIDGE TOO FAR FOR THE AMERICAN PUBLIC.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THERE&#39;S TWO ISSUES. ONE IS JUDICIAL NOMINEES. YOU&#39;RE RIGHT TO KNOW THERE ARE  OPEN SEATS. IT&#39;S NOT COURT PACKING BUT  FIGHTING REPLACEMENTS. THEN EXECUTIVE NOMINEES. HARRY REID AND DEMOCRATIC  LEADERSHIP FOCUSED ATTENTION  WITH RESPECT TO NUCLEAR OPTION. THEY SAID, LISTEN, YOU HAVE TO  BE ABLE TO CHOOSE YOUR OWN TEAM. GOING TO STOP THE PRESIDENT FROM CHOOSING HIS OWN TEAM WE&#39;RE  GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE THE  RULES. WHEN THEY DID THIS THE FIRST  TIME, THEY BROUGHT TO THE BRINK  AND ULTIMATELY JOHN McCAIN AND  OTHER SENATE REPUBLICANS SAID  OKAY, OKAY, WE&#39;LL GIVE YOU SIX  OR SO NOMINEES BUT THAT&#39;S IT. YOU CAN PRESERVE THE RIGHT TO GO DOWN THIS PATH BUT THAT&#39;S IT. LOOKS LIKE WE&#39;RE GOING TO GO  DOWN THAT PATH ONE MORE TIME. REID PUTTING THE PAUSE BUTTON,  TRY THIS A LITTLE MORE AND SEE  WHAT HAPPENS. I CAN FORCES THEM DOING THE  EXACT SAME THING, HAVING THE  EXACT SAME RESULT AND GOING  THROUGH THE WHOLE ENTERPRISE  TIME AND TIME AGAIN. IT&#39;S DRAGGING POLITICAL FEET.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE  EXECUTIVE AND JUDICIAL NOMINEES, KAREN, IS THE ONLY THING  HAPPENING IN AMERICAN GOVERNMENT IS HAPPENING IN THE JUDICIAL  BRANCH. THAT&#39;S INCREASINGLY WHERE LAWS  ARE CRAFTED. AS MOTHER JONES POINTS OUT  AUTHORIZED FOR 11 JUDGESHIPS  D.C. COURT PRESENTLY HAS ONLY  EIGHT JUDGES. REPUBLICANS CLAIM THE COURT IS  EVENLY DIVIDED BY JUDGES  APPOINTED BY REPUBLICANS AND  DEMOCRATS BUT THE COURT ALSO HAS SIX SEMIRETIRED SENIOR JUDGES  WHO HEAR CASES. WHEN THEY ARE CONCLUDED THEY  HAVE A 9-5 MAJORITY. MANY NOMINEES ARE HARD CORE  CONSERVATIVE IDEOLOGUES. THEY WANT TO PRESERVE THAT AT  ALL COSTS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; TWO THINGS GOING ON HERE. ONE THING, PRESERVING THAT  ADVANTAGE. PACKING. GOD FORBID WE PACK IT WITH  MODERATES OR LIBERALS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE&#39;RE NOT CONCERNED OF  IDEOLOGUE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ON THE OTHER HAND, THE  LANGUAGE THEY ARE USING IN  CHALLENGING PRESIDENT OBAMA, THE LANGUAGE CORNYN WAS USING ON  THIS, IT WAS PART OF THE ONGOING MEAN DESIGNED TO UNDERMINE THIS  PRESIDENT. HE&#39;S A CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYER. TO SAY HE IS COURT PACKING, TO  SAY HE DOESN&#39;T UNDERSTAND HIS  ROLE, DUTIES. AGAIN, WE&#39;VE HEARD IT TIME AND  TIME AGAIN. I&#39;LL DO A LITTLE PLUG FOR MY  SHOW.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; PLEASE DO. DISRUPT THIS CONVERSATION.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ONE THING WE&#39;RE NOT TALKING  ABOUT IS THE IMPACT IT&#39;S HAVING  ON DAILY PEOPLE, SPEEDY JUSTICE, RIGHT TO SPEEDY TRIAL, SPEEDY  PATH TO JUSTICE, THAT IS  GUARANTEED TO EVERY AMERICAN  UNDER THE CONSTITUTION AND IT IS BEING SLOWED DOWN.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ALEX IS RIGHT THE MAIN  LEGISLATIVE BUSINESS IS IN THE  COURTS. YOU&#39;RE TALKING ABOUT BIRTH  CONTROL MANDATE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; EPA REGULATIONS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; TEXAS WITH ABORTION LAWS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I&#39;M SAYING THERE ARE PLENTY  OF CASES, WHETHER IT&#39;S SMALL  BUSINESSES OR INDIVIDUALS  WAITING AND WAITING YEARS  BECAUSE THE COURTS ARE SO  OVERWHELMED.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YES. THAT PROBLEM IS MORE THAN JUST  NOMINEES. THAT&#39;S ABOUT FUNDING JUDICIARY. FOR INSTANCE, PUBLIC DEFENDERS  HAVE NO MONEY TO DO THE TRIALS. YOUR POINT, SOME OF THE BIG  LEGISLATIVE BUSINESS IS BEING  DECIDED IN THE COURT SYSTEM  TODAY. LITERALLY TODAY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE OTHER ISSUE IS  REGULATORY. WE&#39;VE SEEN NOTHING ON  LEGISLATIVE SIDE, JUDICIAL  ACTION, REGULATORY IS HUGE. YOU&#39;VE GOT A GUY RUNNING FINANCE AGENCY ED DEMARCO REFUSED TO  COMPLY WITH HUD&#39;S DESIRE TO DO  LOAN MODIFICATIONS ON SOME OF  THESE MORTGAGES. WE ARE STARTING TO SEE THE  HOUSING MARKET. AGAIN, NOT IN A SWOON BUT  CLEARLY PLATEAUING THE RISE IN  THE LAST MONTHS. MEL WATTEAU WHAT&#39;S INTERESTING  MEL WATT IS --  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; FOR FREDDIE AND FANNIE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; OPPOSED IDEOLOGICAL WHO DO  NOT WANT TO SEE BANKS GIVE BACK  ON LOAN MODIFICATIONS. THIS IS A BIG DEAL. THE OTHER THING TO POINT OUT IN  ADDITION TO A SITTING MEMBER OF  CONGRESS, MEL WATT IS AN  AFRICAN-AMERICAN. I THINK FROM A POLITICAL  PERSPECTIVE THIS IS GOING TO  FIRE UP OBAMA BASE IN THE  MIDTERMS POTENTIALLY WHEN PEOPLE SEE THESE KINDS OF THINGS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; PATRICIA MILLET HAS TED CRUZ  CONSENT. THAT&#39;S LIKE A THREE-HEADED  RABBIT IN THE WILD. THERE IS NO IDEOLOGICAL --  THERE&#39;S A REASON TO OPPOSE HER  NOMINATION EXCEPT FOR THIS  COMPLETELY TRUMPED UP IDEA OF  COURT PACKING.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; EVERYONE FROM JOHN ROBERTS,  ABA ACROSS THE SPECTRUM HAS SAID THIS IS IMPORTANT. THIS IS A PROBLEM. THIS IS NOT COURT PACKING. THIS NEEDS TO GET TAKEN CARE OF. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LET ME ASK YOU, GLEN IN TERMS OF THE WORRY, SENATE DEMOCRATS  WORRY ONE DAY WE MAY NOT BE IN  POWER. WE WANT ALL THE LEVERS OF POWER  AT OUR DISPOSAL. IF YOU LOOK AT THE SENATE AT  THIS POINT THE REPUBLICANS CAN&#39;T WIN A NATIONAL ELECTION. THE ONLY REASON THEY CONTROL THE HOUSE THEY GERRYMANDERED  DISTRICTS AND MAKING EFFORTS TO  SUPPRESS PEOPLE FROM  PARTICIPATING IN THE VOTING  PROCESS. IN 2014 UP FOR ELECTION MAKING  DEMOCRATS NERVOUS, 24  REPUBLICANS UP FOR RE-ELECTION  IN THE SENATE AND 10 DEMOCRATS  UP FOR RE-ELECTION. SO THEY COULD GO FORWARD WITH  THE NUCLEAR OPTION. WHO KNOWS, IT MAY NOT EVEN HURT  THEM FOR ANOTHER SIX TO TWELVE  YEARS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK THE OTHER ISSUE HERE  WITH THE SENATE IS CLEARLY  STARTING TO SEE A MODERATION. WHEN YOU TALK WITH -- YOU DO  THIS AS WELL, SAM. WHEN YOU TALK TO REPUBLICAN  OPERATIVES DEALING WITH SENATE  RACES, THEY ARE TALKING IN A  MUCH MORE MODERATE WAY AND MUCH  MORE HOSTILE TO THE HOUSE. I THINK FROM A POLITICAL  PERSPECTIVE. THE THING ABOUT CORNYN AND  GRASSLEY SPEECH, THEY WERE  COMPLETELY LAME.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HOLD ON. KEEP IN MIND, NUCLEAR OPTION  ONLY ABOUT EXECUTIVE NOMINEES. REID DID THIS FOR A PURPOSE. HE DOESN&#39;T WANT TO EXPAND SCOPE  INCLUDING LEGISLATIVE AND  JUDICIAL.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THIS IS A LEVERAGE GAME WITH  REPUBLICANS. THEY DON&#39;T HAVE AUTHORITY. WE&#39;RE GOING TO BE PLAYING LETS  MAKE A DEAL IN THE NEXT FEW  WEEKS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SEE READ PUSH MORE AND MORE  AND MORE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HARRY REID HAS HAD HIS BOXING GLOVES ON OF LATE. THIS IS NOT A FIGHT I WOULD PICK WITH HIM AT THE MOMENT BUT WHAT  DO I KNOW. COMING UP, GLITCHES. NEW DOCUMENTS SHOW ENROLLMENT  FOR AFFORDABLE CARE ACT -- THERE IS THE BEST COVER TO HIT NEWS  STANDS IN A LONG TIME. MAY BE SLOWER THAN THE SITE  ITSELF IF SUCH A THING IS  POSSIBLE. WE WILL DISCUSS WHEN MELISSA  HARRIS-PERRY JOINS US COMING UP  NEXT.","media$content":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":710.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":0,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/rj6kzUzoU4gL?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":0,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":500000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":710.677,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":240,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/_FHDeu7hHDd5?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":420,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":800000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":710.677,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":360,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/LjdHDOcSpp7c?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":640,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"media$thumbnails":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"image","plfile$duration":0.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"JPEG","plfile$height":1080,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_wag_a_131101.jpg","plfile$width":1920,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"link":"","pubDate":1383332100000,"plmedia$defaultThumbnailUrl":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_wag_a_131101.jpg","nnd$associatedPlaylist":{"href":"http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_18424734"},"nnd$brand":"MSNBC","nnd$bureau":"30RockNY","nnd$bviAssetId":"n_wag_a_131101","nnd$canonicalUrl":{"href":"http://www.msnbc.com/now-with-alex-wagner/watch/new-gop-filibustering-a-bridge-too-far-59366979887"},"nnd$distributionProfile":["MSN-CA"],"nnd$firstAiredAtUtc":1383321583000,"nnd$lastAiredAtUtc":1383321583000,"nnd$lastEditorialChangeAtUtc":1383332136000,"nnd$longTitle":"New GOP filibustering a 'bridge too far'?","nnd$playCount30":2579,"nnd$playCountDay":52,"nnd$playCountYear":2548,"nnd$requiresCaptioning":true,"nnd$shortDescription":"Senate GOP members are filibustering two Obama nominations: Patricia Millett to the DC Circuit court and Mel Watt to oversee Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

THAT IS LITTLE CONSOLATION FOR  47 MILLION AMERICANS CURRENTLY  ON FOOD STAMPS. FOR THOSE PEOPLE THE TALKS WERE  DEEPLY DISTRESSING. ONE REPUBLICAN LAWMAKER AFTER  ANOTHER TOOK TO THE MIC  PROPOSING PAINFUL CUTS TO  S.N.A.P. OR FOOD STAMPS BY  ASSERTING STEEP CUTS WOULD HELP  THE MOST VULNERABLE AND NOT HURT THEM. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I&#39;LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH MY COLLEAGUES TO IMPLEMENT REFORMS  IN S.N.A.P., CUT BACK ON WASTE,  FRAUD, ABUSE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHY DOES SAFETY NET NEED  REFORM, PEOPLE ARE TANGLED UP  AND STUCK. THE HOUSE ADDRESSES THIS BY ENDS BENEFITS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO,  QUITE HONESTLY, DON&#39;T QUALIFY  FOR THEM.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; FOOD STAMPS WILL PLAY AN  IMPORTANT ROLE TAKING CARE OF  OUR MOST NEEDY AMERICANS. THE PROGRAM EXISTS TO LIFT THOSE UP THAT HIT BOTTOM NOT KEEP THEM THERE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ASKING PEOPLE TO WORK IN  RETURN FOR FOOD STAMP PROGRAMS  IS NOT ANY FORM OF CRUEL OR  UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT. THE DIGNITY OF WORK HAS LONG  BEEN A PRETTY COMMON THEME  THROUGHOUT AGES.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ENSURING VULNERABLE FAMILIES  RECEIVE THE SUPPORT THEY NEED IN A MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE  MANNER.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE  MANNER. IN OTHER WORDS THEY WANT TO CUT  FOOD STAMPS BY $39 BILLION  BECAUSE SHREDDING SOCIAL SAFETY  NET MAKES SOCIETY MEMBERS MORE  RELIANT? WELCOME BACK SOCIAL DARWINISM. SOME DEMOCRATS ON THE COMMITTEE, ALTHOUGH NOT ALL OF THEM, PUSH  BACK.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I STRONGLY OPPOSE THE CUTS TO S.N.A.P. SO MANY AMERICANS RECOVERING  FROM THE WORST RECESSION IN  GENERATIONS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I JUST URGE EVERYBODY PUT  THEMSELVES IN THE SHOES OF THESE FAMILIES.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THISSES NOT A TIME TO MAKE  SURE THESE FOLKS ARE  DISCRIMINATED AGAINST.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE TWO SIDES WILL TRY TO  RECONCILE $39 BILLION IN CUTS IN LEGISLATION WITH $4 BILLION IN  CUTS ON SENATE SIDE. SNAP SIP YENTS HAVE A MORE  IMMEDIATE CONCERN. BEGINNING TOMORROW IT WILL BE  CUT BY $5 BILLION AS STIMULUS  SPENDING EXPIRES.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S SHAMEFUL BUT WILL HAPPEN FRIDAY. WE HAVE A HUNGER PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY. IT&#39;S NOT FASHIONABLE TO TALK  ABOUT IT. IT&#39;S NOT A COMFORTABLE  CONVERSATION TO HAVE. IT&#39;S A FACT. IT&#39;S HARD TO BE POOR. IT&#39;S VERY HARD TO BE POOR. WE MUST NOT MAKE A BAD SITUATION WORSE BY PILING ON DEEPER CUTS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; JOINING ME IS THE DEMOCRATIC  CONGRESSMAN FROM NEW YORK 16th  DISTRICT ELIOT ENGEL RANKING  MEMBER ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS  COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I HAVE TO ASK YOU IF WE LOOK  AT WHAT&#39;S HAPPENING ON FRIDAY $5 BILLION IN CUTS TO S.N.A.P. WITH GREATER DEEPER CUTS ON THE  HORIZON, I THINK A LOT OF US ARE ASKING HOW DID WE GET TO THIS  PLACE AND WHY DID DEMOCRATS NOT  PUSH HARDER? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, THE S.N.A.P. PROGRAM  WE&#39;RE LOSING FRIDAY IS A RESULT  OF THE PACKAGE FOR THE STIMULUS. THAT WE ALWAYS KNEW WAS FALLING  BACK. I THINK THIS IS A VISCERAL  DIVIDE, ACTUALLY. THE REPUBLICANS, AS YOU&#39;VE SHOWN SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES&#39; SPEECHES, THEY TAKE THE ATTITUDE THAT ALL  THESE PEOPLE ARE RIPPING OFF THE SYSTEM AND GETTING FOOD STAMPS  WHEN THEY DON&#39;T NEED IT. THAT IS THE GENERAL ATTITUDE. THEY HAVE NO IDEA, APPARENTLY,  PEOPLE ARE STARVING IN THIS  COUNTRY, IN THE RICHEST COUNTRY  ON EARTH, WE HAVE PEOPLE -- NOT  ONLY PEOPLE THAT DON&#39;T WORK,  IT&#39;S PEOPLE WHO WORK BUT DON&#39;T  MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO SUSTAIN  THEIR FAMILIES THAT NEED FOOD  STAMPS. SO THIS NONSENSE ABOUT HOW  GIVING PEOPLE FOOD STAMPS WE&#39;RE  MAKING THEM DEPENDENT ON THE  SYSTEM, STUCK ON THE STOCK  MARKET, WHAT WOULD MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES DO, THROW THEM IN THE STREET, BEG FOR FOOD AND STARVE? WE&#39;VE HAD THIS PROGRAM 40 YEARS. THERE HAS BEEN A BALANCE IN THE  FARM BILL BETWEEN THE  AGRICULTURE NEEDS AND THE FOOD  STAMP NEEDS. THIS YEAR, OF COURSE, UNDER THE  AUSPICES OF THE TEA PARTY AND  THEIR CRONIES, REPUBLICANS  DECIDED TO SPLIT THE TWO AND CUT FOOD STAMPS BY $39 BILLION. IT&#39;S UNCONSCIONABLE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HERITAGE ACTION, TO THE  DEGREE THEY PASSED FARM BILL  WITHOUT ANY FUNDING FOR FOOD  STAMPS, TO THE DEGREE THEY ARE  WILLING TO PUT $39 BILLION IN  CUTS ON THE TABLE. WHY HAS THE DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY  IN THE SENATE AND REAL MINORITY  BUT SIGNIFICANT MINORITY IN THE  HOUSE NOT BEEN MORE SORT OF  ATTENTIVE TO THE PROGRESSIVE  CAUCUS THAT WOULD SAY, LISTEN,  IF WE&#39;RE GOING TO HAVE TO MEET  IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PLAYING  FIELD, HOW ARE WE LETTING  GOALPOST MOVE SO FAR TO THE  RIGHT. AT THIS POINT LOOKING AT $5  BILLION IN CUTS THAT HAPPENED ON FRIDAY. BETWEEN $4 AND $39 BILLION ON  TOP OF THAT. WOULDN&#39;T IT HAVE BEEN A BETTER  PLAY TO SAY WE&#39;RE GOING TO  INCREASE FUNDING FOR S.N.A.P.  AND FIND MEASURED CUTS SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE BETWEEN THEIR  FIGURE AND OURS? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, WE&#39;RE IN THE  MINORITY, UNFORTUNATELY IN THE  HOUSE AND WE HAVE LIMITATIONS  WHAT WE CAN DO. THERE WERE MANY, MANY DEMOCRATS, INCLUDING MYSELF WHO SPOKE OUT  FORCEFULLY AND THOUGHT THE  PROGRAM SHOULD THE A LEAST BE  CONTINUED AT THE SAME LEVEL OR  PERHAPS EVEN INCREASED. THE SENATE DID WHAT THE SENATE  NEEDED TO DO. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, THANK GOD, WE HAVE THE DEMOCRATIC  MAJORITY IN THE SENATE SO WE CAN PREVENT CUTS FROM HAPPENING. ULTIMATELY WE WILL PREVAIL AND  MOST OF THE CUTS WILL NOT  HAPPEN. THE FACT THAT THE REPUBLICANS  ARE SERIOUSLY PROPOSING THESE  CUTS IS REALLY A SCARY THING TO  BEGIN W THE ATTITUDE SOMEHOW  PEOPLE ARE RIPPING OFF THE  SYSTEM, THEY ALWAYS TAKE  EXAMPLES AND USE THEM AS THE  NORM. THE NORM IS PEOPLE ARE STARVING  AND THEY NEED HELP AND IT&#39;S A  DISGRACE IN THE 21st CENTURY WE  WOULD BE CUTTING THESE TYPES OF  PROGRAMS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CONGRESSMAN, I TOTALLY AGREE  WITH THAT POINT. I WANT TO OPEN TO OUR FOLKS IN  NEW YORK. THAT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED,  INSIDIOUS, TAKING HOLD IN SOME  AREAS OF THE AMERICAN  CONVERSATION THAT THESE PEOPLE  WHO RECEIVE FOOD STAMPS OR SOME  KIND OF GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE  ARE TAKERS. AS CONGRESSMAN FROM KANSAS, THEY ARE COUCH POTATOES. ONE IN FIVE S.N.A.P. HOUSEHOLDS  HAVE NO OTHER INCOME, 45% OF  BENEFITS GO TO CHILDREN. S.N.A.P. BENEFITS EQUAL $1.50 A  MEAL.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO ZOOM BACK AND  REALIZE THIS THE SAME PARTY THAT ALSO DOESN&#39;T WANT WORK TO PAY. THEY MIGHT DO THE SAME AS WITH  FARMERS, ELIMINATING INSURANCE,  WHY WOULDN&#39;T THEY INCLUDE A  RAISE TO THE MINIMUM WAGE IN  THIS BILL. WE WANT WORK TO PAY, FEED YOUR  FAMILY AND BE SELF-RELIANT. WE&#39;RE GOING TO CUT THIS BENEFIT  FROM THE GOVERNMENT BUT REQUIRE  INCREASE FROM THE EMPLOYERS. THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE, LOGICALLY COHERENT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IS THE MAJORITY -- I THINK  THE CONGRESSMAN MENTIONED HOW  MANY PEOPLE GET FOOD STAMPS THAT ARE WORKING. I THINK IT&#39;S THE MAJORITY OF  PEOPLE ON FOOD STAMPS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IF YOU LOOK AT CENTER FOR  BUDGET AND PRIORITIES, IF YOU  LOOK AT POVERTY NUMBERS, FOOD  STAMPS, THEY ARE ALMOST  PARALLEL. WE HAVE ECONOMIC DURESS. WE&#39;RE NOT THROUGH THE WORST OF  IT. AS SUCH, THE NEED FOR GOCVERNMENT ASSISTANCE HAS GONE UP. PEOPLE ARE WORKING. THEY HAVEN&#39;T BEEN PAID ENOUGH TO PUT FOOD ON THE STABLE. CONGRESSMAN, I WANT TO BRING UP  A POINT. I WONDER IF IT HOLDS WATER. &quot;WALL STREET JOURNAL,&quot; NOT A  BASTION OF LIBERALISM POINTS OUT STIMULUS EFFECTS FOOD STAMPS  HAVE ON THE ECONOMY. IF YOU TAKE AWAY THESE  SUBSIDIES, ASSISTANCE,  RETAILERS, GROCERS, THE FOOD  INDUSTRY IS WORRIED ABOUT THE  CUTS ON FRIDAY. 48 MILLION AMERICANS WITH $16  BILLION LESS TO SPEND OVER THE  NEXT THREE YEARS AND COMES JUST  MONTHS AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF A PAYROLL TAX CUT WHICH KNOCKED 2% OFF CONSUMERS MONTHLY PAYCHECKS. IS THAT AN ARGUMENT YOU MAKE? THE FACT THIS GOES BACK INTO THE ECONOMY AS DOES TO HEATHER&#39;S  POINT THE MINIMUM WAGE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; OF COURSE. THAT&#39;S ALSO AN ARGUMENT. IT&#39;S A SECONDARY ARGUMENT. THE MAIN ARGUMENT WE&#39;RE JUST  BEING MEAN-SPIRITED AND HURTING  A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN  DESPERATE NEED OF HELP. BUT THE SAME THING, ONE OF THE  REASONS WHY WE HAD TO FIGHT FOR  STIMULUS AND COULDN&#39;T PUT  FORWARD PROGRAMS WE WANTED TO  PUT FORWARD TO STIMULATE THE  ECONOMY, UNEMPLOYMENT DIDN&#39;T GO  DOWN AS MUCH AS WE HOPED. OF COURSE PROGRAMS HAVE AN  EFFECT ON THE ECONOMY. MAIN THING FOR ME, HOW CAN WE  TALK IN THE 21st CENTURY BEING  THE RICHEST COUNTRY IN THE  WORLD, PEOPLE ARE HURTING. THE MINIMUM WAGE WAS MENTIONED,  JUST MENTIONED. WE&#39;RE NOT RAISING MINIMUM WAGE. WE&#39;RE MAKING IT HARDER FOR  PEOPLE TO GET A DECENT WAGE. YOU KNOW, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY&#39;S MANTRA SEEMS TO BE. I&#39;VE GOT MINE, NOW YOU GO FEND  FOR YOURSELF.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; JULIA, YOU&#39;RE IN A RED STATE. W.H.O. WILLIAMS AT FOX, NOT A  CHANNEL KNOWN FOR ITS LIBERAL  VIEWS SAYS IT&#39;S BAD POLITICS FOR REPUBLICANS OF THE AREAS MOST IN NEED OF HELP AND FEEDING PEOPLE  ARE REPUBLICAN STRONGHOLDS. 2010, HIGH NUMBERS STRUGGLING TO FEED THEMSELVES WERE IN RURAL  COUNTIES.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ONCE AGAIN, IT&#39;S BAD  POLITICS. THAT MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL. UNLIKE THE STIMULUS BILL, YOU  CAN DIRECTLY TRACK THIS MONEY. THERE&#39;S NO WAY -- THERE&#39;S NO  OTHER PLACE FOR IT TO GO. GOES DIRECTLY BACK TO THE  ECONOMY, GROCERY STORE, RED  STATES, BLUE STATES, YOU NAME  IT. IT&#39;S ECONOMICS 101. DO NOT ASK ME WHY POLITICSES --  IT&#39;S CRAZY POLITICS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; PEOPLE VOTING AGAINST  INTEREST.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S WHAT WE&#39;VE BEEN  TALKING ABOUT ALL DAY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE OTHER THING, IT&#39;S  IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT THIS IS  NOT PEOPLE JOBLESS. THISSES PEOPLE WORKING. JONATHAN, YOU WROTE ME A NOTE  ABOUT VETERANS. 900,000 VETERANS AFFECTED BY  THESE CUTS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CHILDREN, VETERANS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ON THE VETERANS PIECE, WHEN  YOU MENTIONED THAT DURING THE  BREAK, IT TOOK ME BACK TO THE  TIME OF THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN  WHEN YOU HAD ALL OF THESE  SELF-RIGHTEOUS REPUBLICAN  MEMBERS OF CONGRESS MARCHING  DOWN TO WAR MEMORIAL STANDING  TALL WITH THE AMERICAN VETERAN. WHY WON&#39;T THE PRESIDENT STAND  WITH AMERICAN VETERANS? WHY IS HE STANDING IN THE WAY OF PEOPLE WHO KEEP US FREE? THE SAME PEOPLE ARE GOING TO  ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN TO VETERANS WHO FOUGHT TO KEEP US FREE AND  WHO ARE HUNGRY AND NOTICED THIS  PROGRAM.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CONGRESSMAN, BEFORE I LET YOU GO, I WANT TO SAY I THINK PART  OF THE PROBLEM HERE IS PERHAPS  FOLKS AREN&#39;T AWARE ABOUT THE  DYNAMICS AND CONTOURS OF THE  DEBATE. THE GOP&#39;S FEET ARE NOT HELD TO  THE FIRE IN TERMS OF THE CUTS  THEY ARE PROPOSING. AS YOU POINTED OUT HEARTLESSNESS OF THIS PLATFORM. THESE HAD PRACTICAL, TANGIBLE  FACTS ON REPUBLICAN, DEMOCRATIC  VOTERS, OLDER VOTERS AND  YOUNGER, TOO. THE MORE WE CAN DISCUSS THIS AND THE MORE IT CAN BE BROUGHT TO  THE FLOOR FOR DISCUSSION, I  THINK THE BETTER IT IS FOR THE  ISSUE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I AGREE. I THINK IT DEFINES THE TWO  PARTIES. YOU MENTIONED A RURAL AMERICA  AND RED STATES. THEY ARE HURTING THEIR OWN  PEOPLE. THEY ROUND PEOPLE UP ON SOCIAL  ISSUES BUT HIT THEM IN THE  POCKETBOOK. WE NEED TO EXPOSE THAT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AS WE POINT OUT, FRAUD,  CONSTANTLY THE FLAG GOP WAVING  ON FOOD STAMPS, FRAUD ACCOUNTS  FOR 1% OF FOOD STAMPS. WE WILL LEAVE IT THERE,  DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN FROM NEW  YORK ELIOT ENGEL, THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THANK YOU TO THE WONDERFUL  AND ALWAYS EXCELLENT JULIA REED.

THIS WEEK CRUZ CHANNELING HIS  INNER JOE McCARTHY RATCHETED UP  THE RHETORIC REFUSING TO WALK  BACK HIS FATHER RAFAEL&#39;S  COMPARISON OF PRESIDENT OBAMA TO CUBAN DICTATOR FIDEL CASTRO. TED CRUZ&#39;S SEASONABLY  APPROPRIATE SIEVE ZEALOT COSTUME IS NOT EXACTLY FRIGHTENING  DEMOCRATS WHO SEE CRUZ AND HIS  DESCENDANTS AS THE ENOF THE GOP  AT LEAST ACCORDING TO MAJORITY  LEADER HARRY REID.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IF I DIDN&#39;T CARE SO MUCH FOR  OUR COUNTRY, I WOULD HOPE HE  WOULD GET THE REPUBLICAN PARTY  NOMINATION. THAT WOULD BE THE END OF THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; INDEED WITH HIS TURN AT THE  CAPTAIN&#39;S WHEEL SIGNS OF A PARTY DECLINE ARE COMING INTO VIEW. ACCORDING TO LATEST NBC NEWS  &quot;WALL STREET JOURNAL&quot; POLL, THE  PUBLIC&#39;S VIEW OF THE REPUBLICAN  PARTY HAS REACHED ANOTHER  ALL-TIME LOW GARNERING JUST 2 %  APPROVAL RATING. AT THE SAME TIME &quot;NEW YORK  TIMES&quot; REPORTING THAT THE  DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS ENJOYING  SOMETHING OF A BOOMLET IN NEWLY  DECLARED CANDIDACIES FOR  CONGRESS IN RED STATES. ALMOST ALL OF THE DEMOCRATIC  CANDIDATES, THE &quot;TIMES&quot; REPORTS, DRIVEN TO RUN OVER DISGUST OVER  CRUZ&#39;S SHUTDOWN STRATEGY. IF I EVER SEE TED CRUZ ALL I&#39;M  GOING TO SAY IS THANK YOU, THANK YOU, SAID NEBRASKA DEMOCRATIC  CHAIRMAN. I WOULD HAVE BEEN IN WITNESS  PROTECTION WAS I DIDN&#39;T HAVE  ANYBODY TO RUN. IF TED CRUZ IS COWED IN HIS  STRATEGY OF WHAT THE NEW YORKER  TERMS UNIVERSAL AGGRESSION IT IS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. &quot;POLITICO&quot; REPORTS IN PRIVATE HE MADE IT CLEAR HE WOULD NOT TRY  TO KNEECAP COLLEAGUES IN PRIMARY RACE DESPITE RECENT CAMPAIGN  AGAINST SENATE REPUBLICANS. CRUZ IS NOTHING IF NOT A  STRATEGIST. IF FOR THE MOMENT HE&#39;S PLAYING  NICE IN THE SAND BOX, IT&#39;S  PROBABLY BECAUSE HE HAS HIS EYES ON BECOMING &quot;KING OF THE HILL.&quot;  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HE SAID YOU DID IT BECAUSE  YOU WANT TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THERE IS A LOT OF PARTISAN  ANIMOSITY IN THIS TOWN. THAT&#39;S UNFORTUNATE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HE WAS SAYING YOU DID IT FOR  POLITICAL REASONS, YOU WANT TO  RUN FOR PRESIDENT. DO YOU? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; MY FOCUS IS ON REPRESENTING  26 MILLION TEXANS AND BRINGING  BACK JOBS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I UNDERSTAND. SAYING YOU DID EVERYTHING  BECAUSE YOU WANT TO RUN FOR  PRESIDENT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, THERE IS --  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S NOT A CONVERSATION YOU WANT TO HAVE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THERE&#39;S A CLASSIC POLITICAL  STRATEGY THAT IF YOU CAN&#39;T  DEFEND SUBSTANCE YOU CHANGE THE  TOPIC.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; DO YOU WANT TO RUN FOR  PRESIDENT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; MY FOCUS IS ON THE U.S.  SENATE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; JOINING ME JONATHAN CAPEHART, GARDEN AND GUN MAGAZINE, JULIA  REED, AUTHOR OF, OF COURSE, MAMA PUT VODKA IN SANGRIA, NORM  WARNSTEIN, CO-AUTHOR OF &quot;IT&#39;S  EVEN WORSE THAN IT LOOKS.&quot; AND HEATHER McGEE. NORM, I MUST GO TO YOU FIRST. IT&#39;S AMAZING. TED CRUZ CLIPS, WE HEAR THEM AND WE&#39;RE CHUCKLING, SO TRANSPARENT  AND INSINCERE, YET HE HOLDS  CONSIDERABLY SPRAY IN THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY. IS HIS INFLUENCE ON THE RISE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I MUST SAY, LOOKED AT MY  CALENDAR TO SEE IF IT&#39;S APRIL  1st, APRIL FOOL&#39;S DAY AND NOT  HALLOWEEN. I THINK HE&#39;S ON THE RISE. FRIGHTENING. IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THE PUTATIVE  PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES, THE  VOTE, THE DEBT PROBLEM, THEY  VOTED AGAINST IT. THAT INCLUDES PAUL RYAN IN THE  HOUSE, RAND PAUL AND MARCO RUB  YOCHLT BUT MARCO RUBIO, WHO IS  NOT A DUMB GUY HAS LOOKED AT THE TERRITORY OUT THERE. FIRST MOVED AWAY TO GET TO THE  RIGHT OF CRUZ, NOW HE&#39;S DROPPED  HIS OWN IMMIGRATION BILL. THESE GUYS ALL BELIEVE THAT THE  FUTURE FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS OF THE PARTY IS OVER ON THE RADICAL SIDE OF THE RIGHT. WHO IS THE TOP LEADER? IT&#39;S TED CRUZ. IF YOU LOOK AT THE MEAN  DEVELOPED WITH RUSH LIMBAUGH,  SEAN HANNITY AND OTHERS, AFTER  THE DISASTER AND NEARLY  SOMETHING WORSE, OUR SPINELESS  LEADERS CAVE JUST ON THE VERGE  OF VICTORY. TED CRUZ WOULD HAVE LED HIM TO  VICTORY IF HE HADN&#39;T GIVEN IN. GOT THE ZEITGEIST.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHAT&#39;S INCREDIBLE, HEATHER,  THE MINUTE AFTER THE SHUTDOWN  ENDED -- ANOTHER SENATOR SWORN  IN, MAYBE HE CAN MAKE A  DIFFERENCE, CORY BOOKER,  OFFICIAL DEMOCRATIC SENATOR FOR  NEW JERSEY. TO TED CRUZ AND HIS INFLUENCE,  27 GOP SENATORS DISPROVED IN THE LAST TWO DAYS OF THEIR OWN VOTE  TO RAISE THE DEBT CEILING. IF THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT WHO HAS THE CAPTAIN&#39;S MEAL IN THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY THAT WOULD  PROVE IT. WE DID THIS BUT HATE WE HAD TO  ADOPT THIS MODERATE POSITION.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THIS POSITION AS PEOPLE WHO  RUN THE GOVERNMENT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YES, EXACTLY. IT&#39;S REALLY UNFORTUNATE. IT&#39;S TED CRUZ, ALSO HERITAGE  ACTION. WE BOTH WORK FOR THINK TANKS,  MINE PROGRESSIVE, YOURS IS A  CONSERVATIVE THINK TANK. WHAT&#39;S HAPPENED UNDER JIM DEMINT IS ENTIRELY SOMETHING ELSE  ENTIRELY. NOT A THINK TANK. IT&#39;S ONE OF THE MORE POWERFUL -- IF RUSH LIMBAUGH MOVED TO  WASHINGTON, GAVE HIMSELF A PHD  AND STARTED THROWING MONEY  AROUND.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HE&#39;S A STATESMAN COMPARED TO  SOME OF THESE PEOPLE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; JULIA, THERE&#39;S A QUESTION --  THE QUESTION IS, I&#39;M A MODERATE  CONSERVATIVE AND I SEE WHAT&#39;S  BEING DONE TO MY PARTY. THAT CAN BE A RED STATE  GOVERNOR, VOTER.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE GOVERNORS ARE SMART  ENOUGH TO DISTANCE THEMSELVES.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HOW DO THEY RECONCILE  GOVERNING WITH THE POLICIES.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHAT ASTONISHES ME IS THE  REST OF THE PARTY CAVED TO THIS  GUY, DIDN&#39;T STAND UP. THE THING IS THERE&#39;S NO WAY HE  COULD HAVE DONE WHAT HE WANTED  TO DO. PEOPLE NEED TO GO BACK TO CIVICS CLASS. IT&#39;S NOT POSSIBLE. TO SAY HE SAVED IS RIDICULOUS. THERE&#39;S NO WAY PHYSICALLY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; POLITICALLY, ELECTORALLY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; TO REVERSE THE HEALTH CARE  LAW. TO SAY HE CAVED IS RIDICULOUS. THERE&#39;S NO WAY IT COULD HAVE  HAPPENED. TED CRUZ MIGHT HAVE GONE TO  HARVARD BUT NOBODY IN HIS BASE  HAS EVEN GONE TO HIGH SCHOOL  CIVICS APPARENTLY BECAUSE THEY  BELIEVE WHAT HE&#39;S TELLING HIM  AND IT&#39;S NOT PHYSICALLY  POSSIBLE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; MEANTIME IT&#39;S WORSE, REPORT  HAS CRUMBLED IN ONE YEAR. 63% OF WOMEN NOW HAVE AN  UNFAVORABLE VIEW, 46% OF  SENATORS HAVE UNFAVORABLE VIEW,  67% OF INDEPENDENTS, 70% OF  WHITE COLLEGE GRADUATES NOW HAVE AN UNFAVORABLE VIEW. TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT BLACK  PEOPLE AND HISPANICS, GAYS AND  LESBIANS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IN THE REALITY-BASED  COMMUNITY, THOSE WHO RESIDE IN  IT, THOSE NUMBERS WOULD FREAK  PEOPLE OUT. GROWNUPS IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY SHOULD BE FREAKED OUT BY THOSE  NUMBERS. WHEN YOU LIVE IN THE SHORT-TERM  POLITICAL -- I DON&#39;T WANT TO SAY REALITY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IN SPACE WHERE NO ONE CAN  HEAR YOU SCREAM.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; TED CRUZ, SENATOR TED CRUZ  AND MIKE LEE AND ALL THESE OTHER FOLKS ON THE FAR RIGHT FRINGE  RESIDE, THEY DON&#39;T CARE ABOUT  NUMBERS. THAT&#39;S A LONG-TERM PROBLEM. FOR THEM THE NUMBER THEY CARE  ABOUT WAS FUNDRAISING NUMBER. TED CRUZ WAS ABLE TO RAISE A LOT OF MONEY AT THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER. WHEN WE SEE THE NUMBERS AT THE  FOURTH QUARTER AND LOOK AT THE  FIRST TWO WEEKS OF OCTOBER, I  BET YOU DOLLARS TO DOUGHNUTS HE  WILL SHOW A FUNDRAISING INCREASE FROM PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE, WHO ARE NOT IN THE REALITY-BASED  COMMUNITY THAT HE&#39;S LEADING THE  CHARGE, LEADING THE FIGHT FOR  THEM, EVEN THOUGH AS YOU&#39;VE JUST SAID, THERE WAS NO WAY IN HELL  TED CRUZ WOULD SUCCEED IN  ANYTHING HE WAS PUSHING.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LET ME GIVE HIM HIS DUE. THE PERSON MOST UPSET IS JIM  DeMINT. HE SPENT 10 YEARS TO BUILD  HIMSELF UP TO BE THE NEW LEADER  OF THE RADICAL WING OF THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY, THE ROBERT  TAFT OF THE 2010 PLUS PERIOD. IN 10 MONTHS TED CRUZ ECLIPSED  HIM. NOBODY TALKS ABOUT JIM DeMINT  BUT TED CRUZ. THEY WIELD POWER BUT HE&#39;S THE  LEADER, THE ACKNOWLEDGED LEADER, I THINK, OF THAT WING OF THE  PARTY. IT&#39;S THE DOMINANT WING OF THE  PARTY. WE SHOULD NOT DISCOUNT THE  POLITICAL SAVVY AND BRILLIANCE  OF THIS GUY. IT&#39;S DEMAGOGUE BRILLIANCE,  DANGEROUS ONE. THIS GUY IS SCARE Y.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HEATHER, THE OBSTRUCTION AND  OBFUSCATION CONTINUES. WE HEAR WORD THEY ARE THREATEN  TO FILIBUSTER -- BLOCK JANET  YELLIN FOR FED CHAIR, JEH  JOHNSON FOR SECRETARY OF  HOMELAND SECURITY AND PATRICIA  MILLETTE SEATED ON THE D.C.  CIRCUIT COURT, THE SECOND MOST  IMPORTANT COURT IN THE COUNTRY. THIS IS HAPPENING AT THE SAME  TIME THE DEFICIT, WHICH IS  ARGUABLY THE THING THE TEA PARTY IS WORRIED MOST ABOUT IS AT THE  LOWEST IT HAS BEEN IN FIVE  YEARS. AT 2013, $680.3 BILLION. IS THAT CAUSE FOR THEM TO MAYBE  RELAX A LITTLE ON THIS? NOT AT ALL. ABSOLUTIST, DOGMATIC PLATFORM  THEY ARE ON.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. IT HAS BECOME THEIR ULTIMATE  POLITICAL STRATEGY TO STOP  GOVERNMENT FROM DOING ANYTHING  EFFECTIVE. IT DOESN&#39;T MATTER THEY ARE PART  OF GOVERNMENT, SORT OF SHREDDING THEIR OWN NEST. IF THE PRESIDENT WERE ABLE TO  CONFIRM NOMINEES, HAVE THE D.C.  CIRCUIT ACTUALLY FUNCTION, TO  HAVE A FED CHAIR, RIGHT, AT A  TIME WHEN THE FED IS THE ONLY  PIECE OF THE GOVERNMENT THAT&#39;S  ACTUALLY STILL ABLE TO DO  ANYTHING FOR THE FACT WE SAW THE JOBLESSNESS CRISIS IN THIS  COUNTRY, THEY WOULD BE LOSING ON THEIR SHORT-TERM, I COMPLETELY  AGREE WITH YOU, JONATHAN,  POLITICAL STRATEGY. UNTIL WE CAN SEE SOME SENSE OF  ACCOUNTABILITY, I THINK WE HAD  THAT FOR A MOMENT WITH THE  SHUTDOWN, UNFORTUNATELY THE  MEDIA NARRATIVE HAS MOVED ON TO  A BIGGER PIECE OF GOVERNMENT  DYSFUNCTION, THE HEALTH CARE  WEBSITE ROLLOUT, UNTIL WE SEE  THAT KIND OF ACCOUNTABILITY, I  DON&#39;T THINK -- NORM, MAYBE  YOU&#39;VE GOT AN INSIDE IDEA BUT I  DON&#39;T THINK THEY ARE GOING TO  CHANGE THE STRATEGY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I WOULD SAY, JULIA, WE WERE  TALKING ABOUT GOVERNORS, E.J.  WRITES, FOUR YEARS AGO THE THREE OFF YEAR RACES, VIRGINIA, NEW  JERSEY AND NEW YORK PRESTAGED  THE REPUBLICAN SWEEP OF 2010. IN THE CASE OF THE FIRST TWO,  THE RISE OF THE TEA PARTY. THIS YEAR ALL THREE SIGNAL THE  COLLAPSE OF THE TEA PARTY AND  MOBILIZATION OF BOTH THE  POLITICAL CENTER AND POLITICAL  LEFT. YOU&#39;RE GOING TO MAYBE HAVE --  NOT MAYBE BUT LIKELY HAVE  DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA. YOU HAVE CHRIS CHRISTIE MODERATE BY MEASURE OF THE TEA PARTY. IN NEW YORK CITY WE&#39;RE GOING TO  HAVE PROBABLY OUR FIRST  DEMOCRATIC MAYOR FOR A LONG  TIME. WHILE THE TEA PARTY MAY HAVE  HIJACKED WASHINGTON AND  CONGRESS, AT THE STATE LEVEL I  THINK THE PLATFORM HAS BEEN  REPUDIATED.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LISTEN, AS WE JUST SAW IN  THOSE CLIPS, THIS IS EVERY  DEMOCRAT&#39;S DREAM. IF THEY COULD HAVE BEEN SMART  ENOUGH TO DO THAT, GAYLE COLLINS WROTE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE,  COMMIES, RAISING THIS CHILD FROM BIRTH. THE DEMOCRATS HAVE GOTTEN THEIR  ACT TOGETHER THEY WOULD HAVE  INVENTED TED CRUZ. AS IT IS, HE&#39;S JUST A GIFT TO  THEM. REPUBLICANS ARE NOT GOING TO WIN AN ACTUAL ELECTION FOR A VERY  LONG TIME AFTER THIS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; JONATHAN, WHENEVER WE SEE  TAPE OF TED CRUZ, THE NEW YORKER HAS A GREAT PIECE ON SORT OF HIS CHARACTER, AS JULIA SAID,  ORIGINAL SNAKE OIL SALESMAN,  DISINGENUOUS. ASKED, ARE YOU RUNNING FOR  PRESIDENT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LIKE &quot;SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE.&quot;  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HE TAKES WHATEVER CRITICISM  IS GENUINE, CRITICISM DIRECTED  AT HIM AND THROWS IT RIGHT BACK, I&#39;M NOT MANIPULATING MY POWER BY REJECTING GOVERNANCE, IT&#39;S  PRESIDENT OBAMA -- ARE YOU  RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT? WHEN PEOPLE ARE ASKED QUESTIONS  THEY DON&#39;T WANT TO ANSWER, THEY  TRY AND SWITCH THE SUBJECT,  WHICH HE THEN DOES.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; RIGHT. THAT&#39;S WHEN WE BURST OUT  LAUGHING. WOW, WE ACTUALLY DID FALL  THROUGH THE GLASS HERE. HE&#39;S DOING THE THING HE WAS DE DEKRAD DECRYING. WHAT WAS YOUR QUESTION? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S A PROGRAM FORM THAT  CAN&#39;T BE REALIZED, DESTROYING  THE PARTY, YET SOME PEOPLE ARE  BUYING IT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; RIGHT. IT&#39;S DESTROYING THE PARTY BUT  ALSO DESTROYING THE COUNTRY. WHAT THIS COUNTRY NEEDS IS A  TWO-PARTY SYSTEM WITH TWO  FUNCTIONING PARTIES THAT  UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO  GOVERN. REMEMBER, NOT ALL THAT LONG AGO  PEOPLE WOULD SAY THE DARNEDEST  THINGS, MAKE PROMISES THEY KNEW  THEY COULDN&#39;T KEEP, THEN GET TO  WASHINGTON AND REALITY WOULD SET IN. OH, YEAH, I HAVE MY  CONSTITUENTS. THERE WOULD COME THOSE TIMES WE  WILL NEED TO TAKE VOTES THAT  WILL KILL ME AT HOME BUT THE  RIGHT THING TO DO FOR THE  COUNTRY. ONE PARTY OF THE TWO-PARTY  SYSTEM REJECTED THAT. NOT DOESN&#39;T DO IT, REJECTS IT  COMPLETELY AND IS BEING REWARDED FOR IT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IN THE SHORT-TERM.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; PEOPLE NOW SITTING IN  CONGRESS SINCE 2010 WERE ACCEPT  TO WASHINGTON TO DO EXACTLY  WHAT&#39;S HAPPENING, STOP  GOVERNMENT, SHUT DOWN THE  GOVERNMENT, DEFAULT ON THE DEBT  BECAUSE IT DOESN&#39;T MATTER.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; RIGHT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; TO BRING IT BACK TO SOME  SEMBLANCE OF REALITY, THE KING  IN SHREK SAID, SOME OF YOU MAY  DIE IN THIS OPERATION BUT THAT&#39;S A SACRIFICE I&#39;M WILLING TO MAKE. THAT&#39;S TED CRUZ AND THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S IT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; OF COURSE HE ALSO SAID WE  NEED JOBS. THAT&#39;S WHAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON  EVEN AS HE SHUT DOWN THE  GOVERNMENT, COST THE ECONOMY $34 BILLION AND HAD JOBS GO DOWN THE TOILET. SO YOU CAN ONLY MARVEL AT WHAT  THEY CALL IN TEXAS CHUTZPAH.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BACK TO YOUR POINT, WHAT IS  TRULY MARVELOUS, PEOPLE ARE  FALLING FOR IT, THE ARTICLE YOU  POINTED OUT SAYS HE LOOKS  LIKE -- HELP ME, THE ACTOR.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BILL MURRAY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; APPARENTLY REALITY HAS LEFT  MY OWN BRAIN. BILL MURRAY, EXCEPT BILL MURRAY  IS A SATIRIST, AND PEOPLE GET  HE&#39;S BEEN A SMARMY SEE-THROUGH  GUY. IT&#39;S ASTONISHING THE WHOLE WORLD ISN&#39;T CRACKING UP LIKE WE ARE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S WORSE THAN A BAD  HALLOWEEN COSTUME.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S TERRIFYING -- I&#39;M  SORRY --  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHERE IS THE DIVIDE. AS THEY SAY IN -- CUT MYSELF OFF THERE. ARE WE SAYING GOOD-BYE TO NORM? APPARENTLY WE ARE. RESIDENT SCHOLAR, NORM, I HATE  THIS PART OF THE SHOW. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.

THAT&#39;S WHY I SUPPORT THIS  REFORM.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I CONTINUE TO BELIEVE, AS I  ALWAYS HAVE, THE BEST WAY TO  ADDRESS IMMIGRATION REFORM IS  INDIVIDUAL BILLS THAT BUILD ON  EACH OTHER SEQUENTIALLY. THE SENATE WENT A DIFFERENT  DIRECTION. I WANTED INFLUENCE THE SENATE  CAME UP WITH. I FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR THE  SENATE TO TAT FIRST STEP IN THIS DEBATE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT WAS FLORIDA SENATOR  MARCO RUBIO, ARCHITECTS OF  IMMIGRATION REFORM ABANDONING  HIS OWN WORK LAST WREAK. ON SATURDAY RUBIO SPOKESPERSON  DROVE THE FINAL NAIL IN THE  COFFIN DEEMING ANY CHANCES TO  PASS A BILL A RUSE. WROTE THE SPOKESPERSON, AT THIS  POINT THE MOST REALISTIC WAY  WOULD BE A SERIES OF INDIVIDUAL  BILLS. INDEED, RUBIO ISN&#39;T ONLY ONE  TEARING UP LAST REMAINING SHREDS OF BIPARTISAN IN THE GOP. YESTERDAY REPUBLICAN CHAIR OF  THE HOUSE HOMELAND SECURITY  COMMITTEE MIKE McCALL REFUSED AN INVITATION TO MEET WITH THE  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  TO DISCUSS THE PATH AHEAD ON  IMMIGRATION REFORM. HERE IS WHAT HE TOLD THE RADIO  HOST.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I AM NOT GOING DOWN THE ROAD  OF CONFERENCING WITH THE SENATE  BILL. I TOLD BOEHNER HE NEEDS TO STAND UP VERY CLEAR THAT WE&#39;RE NOT  GOING TO CONFERENCE WITH THE  SENATE ON THIS. WE&#39;RE NOT GOING TO CONFERENCE  WITH THE SENATE PERIOD. LAURA, I WAS INVITED TO THE  WHITE HOUSE YESTERDAY, AND I  REFUSED TO MEET WITH THE  PRESIDENT BECAUSE I SAW IT AS A  POLITICAL TRAP.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt;&gt; JOINING US FROM AUSTIN,  TEXAS, PROFESSOR AT THE LBJ  SCHOOL OF PUBLIC POLICY AT THE  UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, VICTORIA  DESOTO. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING  US. I&#39;M RATHER SHOCKED ABOUT MIKE  McCALL&#39;S STATEMENT THAT MEETING  WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS A POLITICAL TRAP. SEEMS LIKE WE&#39;VE MADE 180 ON THE SUBJECT OF IMMIGRATION REFORM. WHERE ARE YOU ON THIS? ARE YOU OPTIMISTIC ANYTHING CAN  GET DONE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ALEX, I&#39;M ACTUALLY  PESSIMISTIC. I KNEW EARLY ON IF WE GET INTO  OCTOBER, NOVEMBER, WE WEREN&#39;T  GOING TO SEE IMMIGRATION REFORM  COME THROUGH. FIRST OF ALL WE&#39;VE SEEN IT FALL  APART IN TERMS OF THE HOUSE NOT  WANTING TO MOVE FORWARD ON  COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION  REFORM. COMPREHENSIVE REFORM IS KEY. YOU CAN&#39;T HAVE A PIECEMEAL  APPROACH. IMMIGRATION ITSELF IS A COMPLEX  ISSUE THAT DEMANDS A  COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION. SO YOU CAN&#39;T GO OUT PIECEMEAL. SECOND, LOOK AT THE CALENDAR,  ALEX, WE&#39;RE COMING UP IN THE  WEEK WITH BUDGET BATTLES. THE NEW YEAR WE&#39;RE COMING UP ON  THE DEBT CEILING. WE&#39;RE ALREADY IN ELECTORAL  SEASON, A YEAR 2014. ALL OF THESE MARKERS MAKE ME  FEEL INCREDIBLY PESSIMISTIC.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I&#39;M GOING TO OPEN TO MY FOLKS IN NEW YORK. HEATHER, TO THE PIECEMEAL  APPROACH, DICK DURBIN APPARENTLY TOLD &quot;POLITICO&quot; I DON&#39;T THAT  APPROACH BUT THE ONLY  APPROACH -- CHUCK SCHUMER SAID  WE WOULD RATHER HAVE A BIG  COMPREHENSIVE I WILL BILL BUT  ANY WAY THE HOUSE CAN GET THERE  IS OKAY WITH US. IS THAT JUST A NECESSARY NOD TO  THE IDEA OF COMPROMISE OR DO YOU THINK DEMOCRATS MAY ACTUALLY  CAVE ON THIS AND ACCEPT THE  PIECEMEAL APPROACH? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; DEMOCRATS MIGHT CAVE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? THE PIECEMEAL APPROACH FOR THE  HOUSE IS CODE FOR WE&#39;LL DO  BORDER SECURITY, PUNITIVE  MEASURES, WE&#39;LL DO SOMETHING ALL ABOUT BACK TAXES, ALL ABOUT  FINES AND MAYBE A PATH TO EARNED CITIZENSHIP.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; MAYBE NOT. ERIC CANTOR&#39;S KIDS&#39; ACT PROVIDES DREAMERS -- DOESN&#39;T LET THEM  BECOME FULL CITIZENS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; EXACTLY. I THINK UNFORTUNATELY THE  PIECEMEAL APPROACH, NONE OF  ITTING INCLUDE ANY OF THE THINGS THAT ARE LINES IN THE SAND FOR  IMMIGRANT RIGHTS COMMUNITY AND  DEMOCRATS IN THE SENATE. I THINK IT&#39;S SILLY TO THINK  PIECEMEAL MEANS YOU&#39;LL GET A  GREAT BILL WHEN YOU ADD IT  TOGETHER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt;IVITIES I WAS GOING TO SAY  LOOK AT CONGRESS, THEY CAN&#39;T GET IT TOGETHER. THINK IF WE BREAK IT INTO FIVE  OR SIX PIECES, WE&#39;RE NEVER GOING TO SEE ANYTHING DONE. I DEFINITELY AGREE WITH HEATHER, THIS IS CODE FOR WE&#39;RE NOT GOING TO TOUCH IT. MAYBE IN 2018 WE&#39;LL TOUCH IT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IN 2018, WHO IS GOING TO BE  VOTING FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, JONATHAN. LOOK AT THE NUMBERS HERE. THIS IS GALLOP POLL. PARTY ID BY HISPANIC AMERICANS. IF YOU WERE BORN IN U.S.  HISPANIC AMERICANS BOTH PARENTS  BORN IN U.S., 30% REPUBLICANS,  64% LEAN DEMOCRAT. IF YOU&#39;RE BORN IN THE U.S. WITH  ONE OR BOTH PARENTS OUTSIDE OF  U.S. 57% DEMOCRAT, OUTSIDE OF  THE U.S., 57%. THIS IS 60% OF THE HISPANIC  COMMUNITY IS ALREADY VOTING FOR  DEMOCRATS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; A VOTER LATINO POLL,  BATTLEGROUND JUST AFTER THE  ELECTION ACTUALLY HAD SOME  INTERESTING NEWS FOR THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY, WHICH IS  LATINO VOTERS, IF YOU ASK THEM  THEIR POLITICAL IDEOLOGY AND  LEAVE ASIDE PARTY, CONSERVATIVE, PROGRESSIVE, THEY ARE BY AND  LARGE CONSERVATIVE. REPUBLICANS ARE LEAVING VOTES ON THE TABLE, WILLFULLY LEAVING  VOTES ON THE TABLE. CAN I JUST SAY SOMETHING ABOUT  THE CONGRESSMAN&#39;S POLITICAL TRAP ARGUMENT? REMEMBER DURING THE DEBT CEILING CRISIS WHEN REPUBLICANS KEPT  COMPLAINING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WON&#39;T REACH OUT TO US. HE WON&#39;T TALK TO US. AND THEN HERE IS THE PRESIDENT  OF THE UNITED STATES DOING  EXACTLY WHAT A PRESIDENT SHOULD  DO AND THE REPUBLICANS SPURN  HIM.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S UNBELIEVABLE. VIC VICKI, WE KNOW EARLIER THIS  WEEK, 600, I THINK A GROUP OF  600 ACTIVISTS, INCLUDING SERIOUS HEAVY HITTERS, CHAMBER OF  COMMERCE, MAYOR BLOOMBERG, HEAD  OF THE MARRIOTT CORPORATION,  RUPERT MURDOCH, THERE&#39;S  BUSINESS, MOD RAL  SEMICONSERVATIVE WING OF THE  PARTY THAT WOULD LIKE TO SEE  SOMETHING DONE. DO THEY HOLD ANY SWAY ON THIS  TOPIC IN TERMS OF GOP AT LARGE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THIS IS A COALITION REFERRED  TO AS THREE Bs, BIBLES, BADGES,  AND BUSINESS. YOU THINK ABOUT THIS COALITION  AND THIS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. IF ANYBODY IS GOING TO GET THE  EAR OF REPUBLICANS IS GOING TO  BE THEM BUT THEY ARE NOT HAVING  ANY LUCK. THE REASON FOR THAT IS THERE&#39;S  ABOUT TWO TO THREE DOZEN  REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE WHO  HAVE SAID THEY ARE NOT GOING TO  BUDGE. EVEN THOUGH EVERYBODY ELSE IN  THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND FOLKS  IN THE SENATE, FOLKS IN THE  DEMOCRATIC PARTY WANT TO SEE  THIS DONE, INCLUDING THE  BUSINESS COMMUNITY, THERE IS NO  BUDGE. THERE&#39;S THIS INTRANSIGENT  SEGMENT. DOESN&#39;T MATTER HOW MANY FOLKS  FLY IN, OVER 600 FLEW IN FOR  THIS, THERE IS JUST A SEGMENT  THAT WON&#39;T BUDGE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HEATHER, THE OTHER SIDE OF  THIS IS THE STRATEGY THAT THE  WHITE HOUSE CAN THEN USE, IF  REPUBLICANS DON&#39;T. A KUNLGEL TO MOVE, LATEST IN  EFFORTS BY DEMOCRATS TO INCREASE POLITICAL PRESSURE ON  REPUBLICANS WHO RULED OUT SENATE BILL IN HOPES OF USING THE ISSUE IN 2014 AND 2016.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK WE SHOULD SEE PEOPLE  RUNNING ADS SAYING THIS PERSON  SUPPORTS OUR CURRENT -- OUR  NATION&#39;S CURRENT BROKEN  IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. IT REALLY GOES TO SHOW  PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT  THE LINEUP OF THAT HEAVY HITTER  COALITION, HOW MUCH RACE AND  FUNDAMENTAL FEAR OF, YOU KNOW, A MORE DIVERSE COUNTRY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; A BROWNER AMERICA.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CAN SHORT WIRE ALL OTHER KIND OF LOGICAL REASONING AND ALL  OTHER POLITICAL DYNAMICS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE FEAR AT THE ROOT OF THIS, AS AT THE ROOT OF SO MANY  THINGS, TED CRUZ AND HIS  STRATEGY OF OBJEFUSCATIOOBFUSCATION, FARM  BILL, COUCH SITTERS, THAT FEAR  IS AT THE BASIS OF ALL THIS  RESISTANCE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; JOHN HARWOOD, CNBC &quot;NEW YORK  TIMES&quot; HAS A GREAT PIECE IN THE  PAPER TODAY TALKING ABOUT THIS  THING, RACE IS THE UNDERCURRENT  WHISPER HERE IN THE IMMIGRATION  CONVERSATION BUT ALSO IN THE  OBAMA CARE CONVERSATION WE&#39;VE  BEEN HAVING.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK THE MAKEUP OF THIS  PANEL AT THIS MOMENT WITH VICKI  IN TEXAS IS THE GREAT FEAR OF  THE GOP. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BECAUSE BABIES, TOO, RACE AND FERTILITY PATTERNS AND IT MAKES  FOR FOLKS GETTING SCARED.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt;

JOHN MEACHEM&#39;S &quot;NEW YORK  TIMES&quot; BEST SELLER &quot;THOMAS  JEFFERSON: THE ART OF POWER&quot;  RECOUNTS THE FOUNDING FATHER AS  HE HIMSELF MAY HAVE. IN PURSUIT OF HIS ENDS,  JEFFERSON SOUGHT, ACQUIRED, AND  WIELDED POWER. OUR GREATEST LEADERS ARE NEITHER DREAMERS NOR DICTATORS. THEY ARE, LIKE JEFFERSON, THOSE  WHO ARTICULATE NATIONAL  ASPIRATIONS YET MASTER THE  MECHANICS OF INFLUENCE AND KNOW  WHEN TO DEPART FROM DOGMA. AS WE GO THROUGH THIS, AS WE  LIVE THROUGH THIS HIGHLY RANK  ROUS, PARTISAN TIME, DO YOU  THINK OUR LEADERS STILL  UNDERSTAND THAT? I WOULD ASK YOU IN SPECIFIC THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY, WHICH SEEMS TO BE INCREDIBLY DOGMATIC RIGHT  NOW. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S WHERE -- THAT&#39;S THE  MOST UNJEFFERSONIAN CREW. THERE IS THE SENSE AMONG SOME  REPUBLICANS THAT THE PERFECT IS, IN FACT, THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YEAH. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND THAT&#39;S -- WE&#39;VE NEVER  REALLY PROSPERED, BROADLY,  POLITICALLY IN OUR HISTORY WHEN  WE&#39;VE BEEN ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED  TO ONE SINGLE THING. BECAUSE THE COUNTRY IS SO  DIVERSE, BECAUSE THE REPUBLIC IS SO BIG, IT WAS ALWAYS A  PROTECTION AGAINST EXTREMISM AND IT WAS ALSO ALWAYS THIS  INCREDIBLY DIVERSE CONFLICT OF  INTEREST. WE WERE ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE  PARTISANSHIP. WE WERE ALWAYS GOING TO BE  DIVISION. JEFFERSON TALKED ABOUT THE  QUESTIONS OF WHAT ARE THE  INTERESTS OF THE MANY ARE THE  INTERESTS OF THE FEW SHOULD  PREDOMINATE IN THE INTEREST OF  HUMAN AFFAIRS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LOOK AT THAT RECALL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ALL THE WAY BACK. SO IT&#39;S MONETIZING DORK-DOM. BUT HE KNEW THAT. THE QUESTION IS WHETHER  PARTISANSHIP IS OF A DIFFERENT  DEGREE OR OF A DIFFERENT KIND. RIGHT NOW I THINK IT&#39;S AN  EXTREME DEGREE. WHAT&#39;S HAPPENED, WHICH JEFFERSON WOULD NOT HAVE APPROVED OF IN  HIS BETTER MOMENTS, WAS IT&#39;S  REFLEXIVE. THAT IS, YOU SAY SOMETHING, SO I DISAGREE AND YOU FORECLOSE THE  POSSIBILITY OF REASON TO TAKE ON BOARD WHAT YOU SAY AND DECIDE  WHETHER IT&#39;S GOOD OR BAD. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BY THE WAY, BRIAN, WHEN WE  TALK ABOUT LEADERSHIP, I THINK  THAT JEFFERSON -- I MEAN, I  DON&#39;T KNOW. OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO  SAY I&#39;M BIASED HERE, BUT  PRESIDENT OBAMA IS VERY MUCH  SOMEONE WHO LIVES IN THE  CROSSHAIRS BETWEEN BEING A SORT  OF PHILOSOPHER AND AN IDEALIST  AND A PRAGMATIST AND I THINK  HAPPENS TO BE PRESIDENT AT A  TIME WHERE HIS PARTNERS ON THE  OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE ARE VERY MUCH BEHOLD ON TO A SORT OF  RECKLESS, DOGMATIC MENTALITY  THAT MAKES THE NEGOTIATIONS  NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT HE CAME INTO  POWER AT A VERY STRANGE TIME. I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A POLARIZING FIGURE. PROBABLY FOR AS LONG AS THE  REPUBLIC. PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS ELECTED AT  THE NATER OF THE ECONOMY AND AT  A TIME WHEN THE PARTIES HAD  SORTED. WHEN THE MOST LIBERAL REPUBLICAN WAS MORE CONSERVATIVE THAN THE  MOST CONSERVATIVE DEMOCRAT. SO THERE WAS REALLY NO INCENTIVE FOR ALMOST ANYBODY IN THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY TO EVER WANT TO PARTNER UP WITH HIM, WITH THE  EXCEPTION OF YOU STILL SEE A FEW HOUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE INCENTIVE TO WORK WITH HIM ON IMMIGRATION  REFORM, BUT NOT HEALTH CARE. THERE&#39;S NO DOLLAR FOR ANY OF  THOSE REPUBLICANS IN DOING THAT. I THINK IT WAS A CONFLUENCE OF  ALL OF THAT STUFF THAT&#39;S MADE  THIS ERA WHAT IT IS, THE OBAMA  ERA WHAT IT IS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YET, JAMAL, SOME PEOPLE ON  THE LEFT WOULD SAY WE NEED TO BE LESS CONCILIATORY, LESS IN  SEARCH OF A BARGAIN WITH THESE  PEOPLE WHO HAVE MOVED THE  GOALPOST SO FAR TO THE RIGHT. MY WORRY IS THAT WE SORT OF END  UP WITH PARTIES -- I MEAN, I  REALLY DO THINK THE DEMOCRATIC  PARTY HAS COME MUCH FURTHER TO  THE CENTER. WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS  POST-OBAMA? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I DON&#39;T KNOW. I THINK EVERYONE IS FIRMLY  ENSCONCED IN THEIR CAMPS. YOU CAN&#39;T TAKE OUT THE  DEMOGRAPHICS. YOU HAVE 30 YEARS OF WAGE  STAGNATION. AT THE SAME TIME, YOU HAVE THIS  INCREDIBLE DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFT  TAKING PLACE IN THE COUNTRY. YOU&#39;VE GOT ALL THE GUYSIC L LIKE,  I&#39;M FROM MICHIGAN, THE AUTO  WORKER, BIG BUFFY GUYS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU&#39;RE A BIG, BUFFY GUY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BUT YOU HAVE ALL THESE FOLKS  CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE. THEY DON&#39;T KNOW WHAT TO DO. WE MAY HAVE REFORMS OURSELVES  TOO MUCH. WE DON&#39;T HAVE EARMARKS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CALLING FOR A RETURN TO  EARMARKS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; PEOPLE USED TO BE ABLE TO  HORSE TRADE. WE MADE HORSE TRADE A BAD IDEA. WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO SOME OF  THAT, I THINK. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; JEFFERSON IT&#39;S BEST TO GIVE  AS WELL AS TAKE IN A SYSTEM LIKE OURS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I LOVE WHEN YOU QUOTE  JEFFERSON. I KNOW YOU SANG US JONAS  BROTHERS LYRICS EARLIER TODAY. THE BOOK IS &quot;THOMAS JEFFERSON:  THE ART OF POWER.&quot; AS SOMEONE WHO&#39;S HELD THE  PAPERBACK AND HARDBACK, I PREFER THE PAPERBACK. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S BETTER FOR YOUR CARDIO  AND STRENGTH. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I DO WEIGHT LIFT WITH IT.

THANKS TO THAT LAW, 97% OF  MASSACHUSETTS RESIDENTS HAVE  HEALTH CARE. &quot;THE BOSTON GLOBE&quot; REPORTS THE,  QUOTE, BESIEGED PRESIDENT, WILL  HIGHLIGHT THE BIPARTISAN NATURE  OF THE MASSACHUSETTS OVERHAUL  AND EMPHASIZE THAT IT TOOK MANY  MONTHS TO SIGN UP RESIDENTS. BEFORE PRESIDENT OBAMA ARRIVES,  HIS TOP LUNTD, HHS SECRETARY,  KATHLEEN SEBELIUS, APOLOGIZED  FOR THE PROBLEMS THAT HAVE THUS  FAR BEDEVILED THE ACA ROLLOUT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LET ME SAY DIRECTLY TO THESE  AMERICANS, YOU DESERVE BETTER. I APOLOGIZE. I&#39;M ACCOUNTABLE TO YOU FOR  FIXING THESE PROBLEMS. AND I&#39;M COMMITTED TO EARNING  YOUR CONFIDENCE BACK BY FIXING  THE SITE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IN A MOVE THAT SURPRISED  EXACTLY NO ONE, REPUBLICANS  GRILLED THE SECRETARY ABOUT  SO-CALLED WEBSITE GLITCHES AND  HER BOSS&#39; REPEATED ASSURANCE  THAT EVERYONE WHO LIKED THEIR  CURRENT PLAN COULD KEEP IT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, SECRETARY, WHILE YOU&#39;RE FROM KANSAS, WE&#39;RE NOT IN KANSAS ANYMORE. SOME MIGHT SAY THAT WE ARE  ACTUALLY IN THE WIZARD OF OZ  LAND. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHO MADE THE -- THE PROBLEM  WITH THIS WHOLE DEBATE IS Y&#39;ALL  WON&#39;T TELL US WHO MADE THE  DECISION. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AMAZON WOULD NEVER DO THIS. PRO-FLOWERS WOULD NEVER DO THIS. KAYAK WOULD NEVER DO THIS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO DRIVE A  FORD, NOT A FERRARI. SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO DRINK OUT OF A RED SOLO CUP AND NOT A CRYSTAL STEM. YOU&#39;RE TAKING AWAY THEIR CHOICE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BUT THIS TIME DEMOCRATS ON  THE COMMITTEE WERE NOT GOING TO  TAKE THE CRITICISM LYING DOWN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I DON&#39;T KNOW HOW YOU KEEP  YOUR COOL, MADAM SECRETARY, WITH THIS CONTINUOUS EFFORT ON THE  PART OF THE GOP TO SABOTAGE THE  ACA, TO SCARE PEOPLE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE&#39;VE HAD A LITANY OF  OBJECTIONS FROM THE REPUBLICANS  ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT,  WHICH HAS DRIVEN THEM TO SUCH A  FRENZY THEY EVEN CLOSED THE  GOVERNMENT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I WANT TO REALLY CONGRATULATE MY REPUBLICAN PALS FOR BEING  ABSOLUTELY 1,000% CONSISTENT. YOU LOVE WHAT&#39;S WRONG WITH THE  WEBSITE AND YOU DETEST WHAT&#39;S  WORKING. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; INDEED, DEMOCRATS ARE EAGER  TO PUT THE SPOTLIGHT ON THE GOP. IN JUST A FEW HOURS, PRESIDENT  OBAMA IS EXPECTED TO SHARE THE  LIMELIGHT WITH THE MOST RECENT  REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR  PRESIDENT, MITT ROMNEY. NEEDLESS TO SAY, REMINDING THE  COUNTRY OF HIS SIGNIFICANT  CONTRIBUTION TO THE DEVELOPMENT  OF OBAMA CARE IS NOT SOMETHING  GOVERNOR ROMNEY IS EXACTLY  EXCITED ABOUT. IN A STATEMENT RELEASED JUST  HOURS AGO, ROMNEY WENT TO GREAT  AND SOME WOULD SAY ALMOST  PAINFUL LENGTHS TO DISTANCE  HIMSELF FROM THE THING HIS OWN  PARTY HATES MOST IN THE WORLD. IN THE YEARS SINCE THE  MASSACHUSETTS HEALTH CARE LAW  WENT INTO EFFECT, NOTHING HAS  CHANGED MY VIEW THAT A PLAN  CRAFTED TO FIT THE UNIQUE  CIRCUMSTANCES OF A SINGLE STATE  SHOULD NOT BE GRAFTED ON TO THE  ENTIRE COUNTRY. HEALTH REFORM IS BEST CRAFTED BY STATES WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT  AND INPUT FROM ITS EMPLOYERS, AS WE DID, WITHOUT RAISING TAXES  AND BY CAREFULLY PHASING IT IN  TO AVOID THE TYPE OF DISRUPTIONS WE ARE SEEING NATIONALLY. JOINING ME TODAY, DEMOCRATIC  STRATEGIST AND PRINCIPAL AT THE  RAVEN GROUP, JAMAL SIMMONS. RANDOM HOUSE EXECUTIVE, JOHN  MEACHEM. AND SENIOR STAFF WRITER AT  SALON, BRIAN BOITLER. ALSO JOINING US, WHITE HOUSE  CORRESPONDENT PETER ALEXANDER. PETER, LET&#39;S TALK ABOUT WHAT HAS JUST HAPPENED. 3 1/2 HOURS OF WHAT I WILL SAY  IS EXHAUSTIVE TESTIMONY FROM  KATHLEEN SEBELIUS, DEFENDING THE PRESIDENT, DEFENDING THE  AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO SORT  OF FOLLOW THAT UP LATER TODAY,  THIS AFTERNOON. HOW CONCERNED IS THE WHITE HOUSE AT THIS POINT? REPUBLICANS SEEM TO HAVE MOVED  SORT OF -- THEY HAVE A HYBRID  STRATEGY OF ATTACKING BOTH THE  WEBSITE AND THE QUOTE/UNQUOTE  PRESIDENT&#39;S FAILED PROMISES THAT EVERYBODY COULD KEEP THEIR  HEALTH CARE. FROM 1600 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE,  WHAT&#39;S THE VIEW? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK THERE&#39;S DEFINITELY  FRUSTRATION. THERE&#39;S OBVIOUSLY CONCERN, AS  YOU HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH  WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS PRIVATELY. THEY HOPE THIS CAN HAVE A BETTER CONTEXT. THEY WANT THIS TO BE EXPLAINED. BECAUSE THE WEBSITE IS DOWN AND  THERE&#39;S LITTLE THEY CAN DO TO  HELP PROVIDE THE EXACT  INFORMATION FOR THOSE AMERICANS  WHO SAY THEIR PLANS ARE BEING  CANCELED OR CHANGED, THEY WANT  TO FOCUS ON THE SMALL NUMBER OF  PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING IMPACTED  THAT WAY. THEY MAKE THE POINT THAT 80% OF  AMERICANS OBVIOUSLY ARE AFFECTED BY -- HAVE GOVERNMENT PLANS OR  PLANS THROUGH THEIR EMPLOYER. IT&#39;S ONLY THE 5%, ABOUT 12  MILLION AMERICANS, THAT THEY  NOTE WHO ARE AMONG THOSE WHO BUY INSURANCE PRIVATELY THAT MAY  HAVE THESE ISSUES. THE PROBLEM IS RIGHT NOW THAT  THERE&#39;S A CREDIBILITY GAP FOR  THIS WHITE HOUSE BECAUSE NOT  JUST WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID,  NOT ONCE, BUT REPEATEDLY SAYING  IF YOU LIKE YOUR PLAN, YOU CAN  KEEP YOUR PLAN. FOR A LOT MORE OF THOSE PEOPLE,  IT&#39;S NOT ABOUT THE PLAN SO MUCH  AS IT IS ABOUT THEIR DOCTORS. ON THOSE NOTICES, IT  SPECIFICALLY SAYS YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP YOUR DOCTOR. THAT&#39;S WHERE THE REAL PERSONAL  RELATIONSHIP EXISTS FOR FOLKS. THAT&#39;S WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE IS  TRYING TO OVERCOME RIGHT NOW. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; PETER, ONE QUICK QUESTION  BEFORE WE LET YOU GO. IN TERMS OF KATHLEEN SEBELIUS,  THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF  REPUBLICAN CALLS FOR SOMEONE,  ANYONE TO GET FIRED, BUT HER  NAME HAS BEEN BANDED ABOUT. IT SEEMS AND SOUNDS LIKE FROM  DEMOCRATS, AT LEAST, AND FROM  ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS SHE&#39;S  NOT GOING ANYWHERE. FIRST OF ALL, ANOTHER  CONFIRMATION PROCESS IS ALMOST  UNTHINKABLE. AND PRESIDENT OBAMA ISN&#39;T THE  KIND OF GUY THAT FIRES STAFF  WHEN THEY ARE IN THE HOT SEAT. WHAT IS YOUR REPORTING TELLING  YOU? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YEAH, IT DOESN&#39;T SEEM LIKE  THIS WHITE HOUSE HAS ANY  INTENTION, CERTAINLY THE  PRESIDENT HAS NO INTENTION TO  GET RID OF KATHLEEN SEBELIUS. THEY&#39;VE REPEATEDLY SAID TO US HE HAS FULL CONFIDENCE IN HER, EVEN IF HE&#39;S EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED AND UPSET ABOUT THE WAY THIS ROLLOUT HAS GONE TO THIS POINT SO FAR. THE CHALLENGE FOR THE WHITE  HOUSE RIGHT NOW IS THEY&#39;RE  WAITING UNTIL MID-NOVEMBER  BEFORE THEY PROVIDE WHAT  KATHLEEN SEBELIUS DESCRIBED AS  RELIABLE ENROLLMENT NUMBERS. NOW THERE ARE MORE DEADLINES  AHEAD THEY&#39;VE GOT TO MEET. THAT NUMBER IN MID-NOVEMBER,  WE&#39;RE ALL GOING TO FOCUS ON IT. EVEN TODAY AS THEY MAKE THE  POINT THAT IN BOSTON, IN  MASSACHUSETTS, IT WAS ONLY 123  PEOPLE THAT SIGNED UP IN THE  FIRST MONTH. 20% OF ALL SIGNUPS IN  COMMONWEALTH CARE IN  MASSACHUSETTS HEALTH COVERAGE  PLANS SIGNED UP IN THE LAST TWO  MONTHS. WE&#39;RE GOING TO FOCUS ON THE  DEADLINE, THAT SMALL NUMBER  WE&#39;LL LIKELY HEAR IN  MID-NOVEMBER. AGAIN, ON THAT SMALL WINDOW OF  TIME FROM DECEMBER 1st TO  DECEMBER 15th, FOR THOSE PEOPLE  WHO ARE LOSING PLANS OR ARE  BEING FORCED TO CHANGE THEIR  PLANS, THAT&#39;S THE SMALL WINDOW  WHERE THEY HAVE TO MAKE THAT  CHANGE IN ORDER TO HAVE  COVERAGE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NBC&#39;S PETER ALEXANDER. THANK YOU, AS ALWAYS, FOR YOUR  TIME, MY FRIEND. MY PALS IN NEW YORK, WE JUST SAT THROUGH A RUCKUS. I DON&#39;T KNOW IF THAT&#39;S THE WORD  TO USE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHATEVER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHICH WAS THE BEST RESPONSE  OF THIS MORNING. JOHN, LET&#39;S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING PETER JUST BROUGHT UP, WHICH IS  THE CREDIBILITY ISSUE. THE PRESIDENT CLEARLY SAID ONE  THING AND ACTUALLY MAYBE MEANT  ANOTHER OR ANOTHER THING IS  HAPPENING. WHICH IS NO ONE IS GOING TO LOSE THEIR INSURANCE. PEOPLE ARE LOSING THEIR  INSURANCE. BUT THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL SORT  OF IMPORTANT SET OF FACTS, WHICH IS THE INSURANCE THEY HAD AND  MAY BE LOSING WAS KIND OF REALLY BAD TO BEGIN WITH. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BUT THAT&#39;S DIFFERENT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; RIGHT, IT IS DIFFERENT. I GUESS FROM YOUR VANTAGE POINT, HOW FAR -- IS THAT A BRIDGE TOO  FAR TO ASK THE AMERICAN PUBLIC  TO UNDERSTAND THAT, YES, WHAT HE WAS SAYING WAS INACCURATE BUT  ULTIMATELY IT IS ALL IN SERVICE  OF BETTER HEALTH CARE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S NOT A BRIDGE TOO FAR IF  THAT HAD BEEN THE EXPLANATION. IF THERE HAD BEEN A SUSTAINED  PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN ABOUT  THIS, BEGINNING BY THE WAY WHEN  THE BILL WAS BEING CRAFTED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I WOULD ARGUE IT IS THE  SINGULAR SIGNATURE DOMESTIC  ACHIEVEMENT. IT&#39;S ALSO REALLY THE SIGNATURE  COMMUNICATIONS FAILURE OF THE  ADMINISTRATION. PEOPLE STILL DON&#39;T KNOW WHAT&#39;S  IN THE DAMN THING. NOW ALL WE KNOW IS IT DOESN&#39;T  WORK. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S WHAT WE&#39;RE BEING TOLD. AND THE MESSAGING AROUND IT NOT  WORKING HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY  POWERFUL AND VERY UNIFIED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND WE HAVE SEEN AGAIN AND  AGAIN IN AMERICAN POLITICS  WHENEVER THERE HAS BEEN  LEGISLATION OR ATTEMPTS TO  REFORM SOCIAL ATTITUDES, YOU  HAVE TO HAVE A SUSTAINED  ARGUMENT AND MAKE IT AGAIN AND  AGAIN AND AGAIN BECAUSE THE  FORCES THAT ARE AGAINST FORWARD  MOTION ARE SO ENTRENCHED. IT&#39;S EASIER TO SAY NO THAN TO  SAY YES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, THERE ARE SOME  IMPORTANT FACTOIDS THAT HAVE  COME UP, BRIAN, IN TERMS OF  PRE-EXISTING -- NOT PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS BUT THIS KIND OF  CATASTROPHIC COVERAGE THAT 15 TO 16 MILLION AMERICANS MAY HAVE. IN &quot;THE WASHINGTON POST,&quot; SARA  CLIFF HAS DONE GREAT REPORTING. ONE STUDY FOUND THAT 17% OF  INDIVIDUAL MARKET SUBSCRIBERS,  THESE ARE THE KIND OF FOLKS WITH THE CATASTROPHIC COVERAGE PLANS, PURCHASE THE SAME PLAN FOR TWO  STRAIGHT YEARS OR LONGER. THERE SHOULD BE AN ONLY THERE. ONLY 17% OF THOSE PEOPLE WITH  THOSE KINDS OF PLANS PURCHASE IT AGAIN. IT IS VERY COMMON FOR PEOPLE TO  SWITCH PLANS YEAR TO YEAR. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOT ONLY IS THERE A LOT OF  TRIM, BUT A LOT OF THE PLANS  BEING PHASED OUT NOW -- I MEAN,  THEY DIDN&#39;T ACTUALLY DO WHAT  INSURANCE IS SUPPOSED TO DO. THEY DIDN&#39;T ACTUALLY PROTECT  PEOPLE FROM BANKRUPTCY OR FROM  BEING KICKED OFF OF THEIR PLANS  AT THE END OF THEIR CONTRACT. AND THAT SYSTEM WILL GO AWAY. I AGREE THE PRESIDENT, INSTEAD  OF SAYING IF YOU LIKE YOUR PLAN, YOU SHOULD KEEP IT, SHOULD HAVE  SAID SOMETHING LIKE, FOR THE  OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF PEOPLE, IF YOU LIKE YOUR PLAN, YOU CAN  KEEP YOUR PLAN. AND I HOPE THAT HE SAYS THAT  TODAY SO WE CAN GET AT THE REAL  REALITY, WHICH IS RIGHT NOW,  THERE ARE THINGS YOU CAN DO TO  MAKE THINGS BETTEREN IF ANYWHERE WHO IS EXPERIENCING RATE SHOCK  OR WHO IS HAVING THEIR PLAN  RESCINDED. THE FACT IS THAT THE GOP DOESN&#39;T WANT TO DO ANY OF THOSE THINGS  UNLESS IT KICKS A TENT POLE OUT  FROM UNDER THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. AND GETTING CLARITY ON THAT  POINT WOULD HELP THE DEBATE  ALONG A LITTLE MORE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; JAMAL, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO BE IN  MASSACHUSETTS, PRESUMABLY TO  HIGHLIGHT THE TIME WHEN  REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS STOOD  ON STAGE TOGETHER AND PASSED  BILLS, THE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT  THAT THERE EXISTED FOR HEALTH  INSURANCE REFORM OR HEALTH CARE  REFORM. WHAT DOES HE NEED TO DO? A LOT OF THIS, AS JOHN POINTS  OUT, IS A COMMUNICATIONS AND  MESSAGING STRATEGY. THEY SEEM INCREDIBLY BUFFETED BY THE LATEST SCANDAL. THIS IS A WEEK TO WEEK CRISIS  MANAGEMENT SITUATION THAT WE  HAVE AT THE WHITE HOUSE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK THE PRESIDENT WILL GO TO MASSACHUSETTS, HE WILL MAKE A SOLID CASE, I&#39;M SURE. THERE WAS A QUESTION IN THE  TESTIMONY TODAY ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WHO IS ULTIMATELY  RESPONSIBLE. WAS IT KATHLEEN SEBELIUS OR THE  PRESIDENT. I&#39;M SURE THE PRESIDENT IS GOING  TO TAKE ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY. HE HAS TO. AFTER THAT, HE HAS TO TREAT THIS LIKE HE&#39;S TREATED SOME OTHER  CRISES WE&#39;VE SEEN IN THE PAST  WITH STORMS. GET SOMEBODY OUT FRONT WHOSE JOB IT IS. DO REGULAR UPDATES ON THIS. MAYBE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE  OUTSIDE THE ADMINISTRATION THAT  CAN BRING SOMEONE IN TO HELP  STEADY THE SHIP. BUT GIVE REGULAR UPDATES. LET PEOPLE KNOW WHAT&#39;S GOING ON. THE ENTIRE SYSTEM SEEMS TO BE  OKAY. IT&#39;S JUST THE WEBSITE IS SCREWY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BUT THAT IS A POWERFUL  NARRATIVE, AS IS THAT OLD TAPE  OF PRESIDENT OBAMA IN 2009  SAYING WITH NANCY PELOSI HOLDING THE SPEAKER&#39;S GAVEL, YOU&#39;RE NOT  GOING TO LOSE YOUR PLAN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THEY HAVE A TORTURED RESPONSE ON THINK PROGRESS ABOUT HOW AT  THE MOMENT OF THE PASSAGE,  ANYBODY THAT HAD HEALTH CARE, IT WOULD LAST, ANYBODY WHO CHANGED  THEIR PLANS IN THE LAST TWO  YEARS, IT&#39;S A LITTLE DODGIER. THEY GOT TO DO BETTER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; MIXED MESSAGING IS A PROBLEM, JOHN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I&#39;VE SAID THIS BEFORE, SO AT  THE RISK OF REPEATING MYSELF --  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NO, PLEASE. WE LIKE A CHORUS AND REFRAIN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THIS COULD BE THE PROGRESSIVE EQUIVALENT OF THE AGRICULTURE  DEPARTMENT RECOMMENDATION THAT  THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION  DECLARE KETCHUP A VEGETABLE  BECAUSE IT&#39;S A STRAIGHTFORWARD,  SIMPLE, EASILY GRASPED FACT. THE GOVERNMENT TRIED TO DO  SOMETHING, AND THEY COULDN&#39;T  EVEN MAKE THE WEBSITE WORK. WE&#39;RE GOING TO BE LIVING WITH  THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS FOR  YEARS TO COME. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT IS WORTH SAYING THAT THE  STATE EXCHANGES ARE WORKING. IT&#39;S NOT JUST THAT EVERYTHING  SORT OF AFFILIATED WITH THIS IS  WORKING. POOR PEOPLE, MEDICAID EXPANSION, THAT&#39;S SOMETHING THAT&#39;S A  PRACTICAL, GOOD THING AND  UNDERSTANDABLE, TANGIBLE THING. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BUT YOUR JOB IS SSYMBOLISM. THIS IS A POWERFUL SYMBOL. IT&#39;S A PROBLEM FOR THOSE OF US  IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE ARE GOING TO TALK MORE  ABOUT THIS AND PUT THIS IN THE  CONTEXT OF THOMAS JEFFERSON,  AMERICAN PRESIDENT, FOUNDER,  FRAMER, FLEXIBLE. JEFFERSON CAN BE DESCRIBED MANY  WAYS, AND WE&#39;LL DISCUSS POWER  POLITICS IN THE AIR OF JEFFERSON AND JOHN MEACHEM&#39;S LATEST BOOK. THAT&#39;S NEXT.","media$content":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":500000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":780.347,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":240,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/1U3xuyMOTgFv?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":420,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":800000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":780.347,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":360,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/qgt6oeVWViF8?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":640,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"media$thumbnails":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"image","plfile$duration":0.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"JPEG","plfile$height":1080,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_wag_1hearing_131030.jpg","plfile$width":1920,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"image","plfile$duration":0.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"JPEG","plfile$height":3840,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Sections/TVNews/MSNBC%20TV/PHOTOS%20-%20AMY/Wagner/_L2A4841.JPG","plfile$width":5760,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"link":"","pubDate":1383154200000,"plmedia$defaultThumbnailUrl":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_wag_1hearing_131030.jpg","nnd$associatedPlaylist":{"href":"http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_49748334"},"nnd$brand":"MSNBC","nnd$bureau":"30RockNY","nnd$bviAssetId":"n_wag_1hearing_131030","nnd$canonicalUrl":{"href":"http://www.msnbc.com/now-with-alex-wagner/watch/an-obamacare-messaging-failure-58581571616"},"nnd$distributionProfile":["MSN-CA"],"nnd$firstAiredAtUtc":1383150978000,"nnd$lastAiredAtUtc":1383150978000,"nnd$lastEditorialChangeAtUtc":1383176018000,"nnd$longTitle":"An Obamacare messaging failure?","nnd$playCount30":3334,"nnd$playCountDay":23,"nnd$playCountYear":3318,"nnd$requiresCaptioning":true,"nnd$shortDescription":"Jamal Simmons, Jon Meacham, Brian Beutler and Peter Alexander discuss Kathleen Sebelius’ House hearing on the Affordable Care Act.","nnd$source":"NOW","nnd$sourceId":"nnd_45258737","nnd$sourceUrlSlug":"now-with-alex-wagner","nnd$titleUrlSlug":"an-obamacare-messaging-failure","nnd$videoType":"Broadcast","nnd$workbenchId":"53415018"},{"$xmlns":{"nnd":"http://partners.nbcnews.com/nnd_mrss"},"guid":"n_wag_1aca_131029","title":"Tech glitches give way to coverage concerns","author":"","description":"The GOP’s leadership has a new focus in criticizing the Affordable Care Act.

IT&#39;S TUESDAY OCTOBER 29th AND  THIS IS &quot;NOW.&quot; &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt;&gt; THIS MORNING MARILYN  TAVENNER HEAD OF THE DIVISION  RESPONSIBLE FOR HEALTHCARE.GOV  ROLLOUT BECAME THE FIRST OBAMA  ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL TO  TESTIFY BEFORE CONGRESS. UNTIL TODAY TAVENNER HAD LARGELY AVOIDED SCRUTINY FROM  REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE INSTEAD  PREFERRED TO TRAIN THEIR FIRE ON HER BOSS KATHLEEN SEBELIUS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I UNDERSTAND YOU&#39;RE NOT  PUBLICLY RELEASING THOSE NUMBERS BUT I&#39;M ASKING, DO YOU HAVE ANY  IDEA OF ON A WEEKLY BASIS HOW  MANY PEOPLE ENROLLED IN HOW DO  YOU NOT KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE  HAVE ENROLLED? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE&#39;LL HAVE THOSE NUMBERS  AVAILABLE MID NOVEMBER.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHILE THE SNIPING OVER THE  WEBSITE PERSISTS IN COMMITTEE,  REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP IS OUT  WITH A NEW MESSAGE. WE&#39;RE OVER THE WEBSITE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE PROBLEM WITH OBAMA CARE  ISN&#39;T JUST THE WEBSITE, IT&#39;S THE WHOLE LAW.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE  PROBLEMS WITH OBAMA CARE RUN  DEEPER THAN JUST THE WEBSITE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE PROBLEMS GO WELL BEYOND A FLOPPED WEBSITE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT IS CLEAR OBAMA CARE AND  FLAWS ARE MUCH MORE THAN THE  WEBSITE. THE WEBSITE IS THE TIP OF THE  ICEBERG.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THIS WEEK REPUBLICANS SMELLED BLOOD IN PRESIDENT OBAMA&#39;S CLAIM NO AMERICANS WOULD BE KICKED OFF THEIR EXISTING PLANS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LET ME REPEAT THIS. NOTHING IN OUR PLAN REQUIRES YOU TO CHANGE WHAT YOU HAVE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND YET AS NBC REPORTS A  DETAILED LOOK AT THE LEGISLATION SHOWS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION  KNEW THAT MORE THAN 40 TO 67% OF THOSE IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET,  OR SOME PERCENTAGE OF 14 MILLION AMERICANS, WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO  KEEP THEIR EXISTING PLANS. NEVER MIND THE FACT THE NEW  PLANS WILL OFFER MORE  COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE AND  SOMETIMES AT A LOWER PRICE TAG,  THIS IS CLEARLY THE NEXT FRONT  IN A WAR ON THE NATION&#39;S HEALTH  CARE LAW.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE KNOW THIS MORNING IS THE  PRESIDENT KNEW THAT THESE  LETTERS WERE COMING. IN THE PRESIDENT KNEW THESE  LETTERS WERE COMING AND STILL  INDICATED THAT YOU COULD KEEP  YOUR HEALTH CARE PLAN IF YOU  LIKED IT, NOW, THAT RAISES SOME  SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT THE  SALES JOB OF OBAMA CARE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NO ONE IS MORE KEENLY AWARE  OF THE COMPLICATED SALES JOB OF  OBAMA CARE THAN, WELL, PRESIDENT OBAMA. IN AN INTERVIEW WITH FUSION LAST NIGHT, THE PRESIDENT TRIED TO  HIGHLIGHT THE BIG PICTURE. BETTER HEALTH CARE, EASIER TO  GET.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ANALYSIS HAS SHOWN THAT IF  YOU&#39;RE BETWEEN 18 AND 34 RIGHT  NOW, ABOUT HALF OF THE PEOPLE  CAN GET HIGH-QUALITY HEALTH CARE FOR LESS THAN $50 A MONTH, LESS  THAN YOUR CELL PHONE BILL, LESS  THAN YOUR CABLE BILL. ABOUT 70% CAN GET IT FOR LESS  THAN $100 A MONTH. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; JOINING ME WASHINGTON BUREAU  CHIEF FOR &quot;HUFFINGTON POST&quot; RYAN GRIM, EDITOR AND PUBLISHER  KATARINA AND WASHINGTON  EDITOR-AT-LARGE FOR THE ATLANTIC STEVE CLEMENS. I DARE SAY THERE&#39;S A LOT OF  NUANCE HERE. I ASKED YOU GUYS WHEN YOU SAT  DOWN HERE, WHAT IS AN UNFORCED  ERROR. IT SEEMS WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW  IS A SERIES OF UNFORCED ERRORS. COULD THE PRESIDENT NOT HAVE  GONE OUT YEARS AGO, MONTHS AGO  AND SAID, LOOK, FOR THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS, YOUR PLANS AREN&#39;T  GOING TO CHANGE. FOR SOME AMERICANS YOUR PLANS  WILL CHANGE BUT THEY ARE GOING  TO GET BETTER AND POSSIBLY EVEN  CHEAPER, WAS THAT NOT  POLITICALLY POSSIBLE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; A MISLEAD.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHAT HE WAS WAS DUMB AND  ILLOGICAL. HE WAS ALSO TELLING PEOPLE AT  THE EXACT SAME TIME THAT THE LAW WOULD REQUIRE THEIR PLANS TO GET BETTER. IN OTHER WORDS, DIFFERENT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; RIGHT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SO YOU CAN&#39;T IN ONE BREATH  SAY YOU WILL HAVE THE SAME PLAN  AND IN THE NEXT BREATH SAY  YOU&#39;LL HAVE A DIFFERENT PLAN. IN A BETTER PLAN BOTH THINGS  CAN&#39;T BE TRUE. THEY WILL ARGUE A LOT OF PEOPLE  WILL LOSE THESE PLANS. THEY WILL SAY THESE PLANS WERE  CRAPPY ANYWAY. THEY HAD TERRIBLY HIGH  DEDUCTIBLES. LOW MONTHLY COST MISLEADING  BECAUSE OF THE DEDUCTIBLE. DIDN&#39;T COVER A LOT OF STUFF,  LIFETIME CAPS. NOW A BETTER PLAN, CHEAPER,  DEDUCTIBLE BUT NOT THE SAME  PLAN.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; KATRINA, THIS COMBINED WITH  WEBSITE GLITCHES, AT THE ROOT OF THE LAW IS SOMETHING GOOD. PARTS OF IT ARE BEING EXECUTED  WELL. BUT FOR PEOPLE LOOKING FOR AN  EXCUSE TO NOT LIKE THE LAW, FOR  PEOPLE SCARED ABOUT GOVERNMENT  OVERREACH, FOR REPUBLICANS IN  NEED OF FRESH TALKING POINTS,  IT&#39;S A PROBLEM, I THINK.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK THERE&#39;S A LOT OF  POLITICAL AND MEDIA HYSTERIA  DISPROPORTIONATE TO THE  PROBLEMS. THERE&#39;S A LOT OF DEMAGOGUING, A  LOT OF INTENTIONAL  MISINFORMATION AND MISLEADING. IF I CAN GO DEEP STRUCTURAL.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; GO DEEP STRUCTURAL.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE DEEP STRUCTURAL IS IF WE  HAD A POLITICAL SYSTEM THAT  WORKED AND WASN&#39;T POLLUTED BY  MONEY WE WOULD HAVE MEDICARE FOR ALL, WHICH WORKS. WE WOULD HAVE A COUNTRY IN WHICH GOVERNORS WOULDN&#39;T REFUSE  MEDICAID EXPANSION AS 22 STATES  HAVE DENYING COVERAGE TO 3.5  MILLION LOW IN COME WOMEN. MORE STATE EXCHANGES WHICH WERE  WORKING. MICHAEL LYNN HAD AN INTERESTING  PIECE AT ROOSEVELT INSTITUTE&#39;S  NEXT NEW DEAL, AT THE HEART OF  IT REPUBLICANS WANT TO INDICT  LIBERALISM AND THAT FORM OF  GOVERNANCE AND GOVERNING. YOU COULD LOOK AT JERRY-RIGGED  ACA OBAMA CARE, IF WE HAD A  SYSTEM THAT WORKED WE WOULDN&#39;T  HAVE NEO-LIBERAL MARKET PATCHING OF PRIVATE INSURANCE PROGRAMS  BUT WE WOULD HAVE A KIND OF 21st CENTURY NEW DEAL PROJECT WHICH  IS MEDICARE FOR ALL WHICH HAS  WORKED AND WORKS IN  INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES AND  COULD WORK HERE IF, IF, IF --  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THOSE IF STATEMENTS ARE  IMPORTANT ONES. WE ALSO HAVE THE POLITICAL  REALITY HERE WHERE EVERY WEEK  SEEMS TO BRING A NEW STORM ON  STEVE. I WILL SAY I THINK THAT THIS IS  A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT. JOSH BARROW MAKES IT. IT IS UNDERDISCUSSED. I DON&#39;T THINK WE HAVE THE QUOTE, SO PLEASE FOLLOW ALONG WITH ME,  AMERICA. HE WRITES, I HAVE SEEN A VAST  OUTPOURING OF CONSERVATIVE  SYMPATHY FOR YOUNG, HEALTHY,  PROSPEROUS PEOPLE WHOSE HEALTH  PLANS ARE GOING UP. WHAT ABOUT TENS OF MILLIONS OF  AMERICANS WHO CURRENTLY LACK  HEALTH INSURANCE AND ARE ABOUT  TO GET ACCESS TO AVAILABLE,  AFFORDABLE COVERAGE. WHIS THE CONSERVATIVE SYMPATHY  FOR PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE WORSE  OFF IF THE LAW DOESN&#39;T GO  FORWARD.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHAT KATRINA AND JOSH ARE  BOTH GETTING AT, THE BASIC  SOCIAL CONTRACT AMONG AMERICANS  IS DEEPLY FLAWED AND NOT  CONNECTING IN THE RIGHT WAYS. WHILE I THINK I AGREE WITH RYAN  THAT THE PRESIDENT AND HIS  MESSAGING WERE POOR, THE  FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE IS YOU DON&#39;T  HAVE ONE NEIGHBOR WORRYING ABOUT THE HEALTH CONCERNS AND  CONSIDERATIONS OF OTHER  NEIGHBORS. IF YOU HAVE PEOPLE WITH A VERY  BASIC LOW LEVEL FORM OF HEALTH  INSURANCE AND THAT&#39;S GOING TO BE KICKED UP, IT&#39;S VERY HARD. WE&#39;VE BEEN SO NEGLIGENT IN THE  HEALTH CARE ARENA SO LONG AND  WE&#39;VE CONVINCED AMERICANS THIS  FUNDAMENTALLY WASN&#39;T PART OF THE BROAD SOCIAL CONTRACT, AT LEAST  A LOT OF THEM, OR WE WOULDN&#39;T  HAVE THIS DEBATE. THAT&#39;S A HUGE ERROR. NOW WE&#39;RE GOING FORWARD. WE DON&#39;T HAVE A ONE SIZE FITS  ALL. PEOPLE HAVE A DIVERSE SET OF  CHOICES. THERE&#39;S A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY. THE PRIVATE SECTOR CONTINUES TO  HAVE LOTS OF ROOM FOR INNOVATION AND COMPETITION AND YET WE&#39;RE  GOING TO MOVE INTO A SYSTEM  WHERE EVERYONE CAN BASICALLY  HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE AND  MANDATED TO HAVE HEALTH  INSURANCE. I&#39;M SYMPATHETIC WITH BOTH SIDES  OF THE EQUATION. I UNDERSTAND HOW HARD IT IS FOR  THE WHITE HOUSE TO COME IN WHEN  YOU&#39;RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A  SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM MUCH LIKE  KATRINA WAS AND YOU&#39;RE TALKING  ABOUT A MIX MASH OF OTHER  POSSIBILITIES FOR CONSUMERS THAT THIS IS INEVITABLY GOING TO  HAPPEN.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; STRATEGICALLY IT SEEMS LIKE  THE WHITE HOUSE THOUGHT, OKAY,  LOOK. THIS THING IS TOO NUANCED, A LOT OF COMPLICATION INVOLVED. WE&#39;RE GOING TO WAIT UNTIL THE  ENROLLMENT PERIOD BEGINS, UNTIL  PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING AND  INTERFACING WITH IT AND SEEING  ITS BENEFITS. THEN WE CAN KIND OF CLEAR UP  THIS STIPULATION THAT NOBODY IS  GOING TO LOSE THEIR PRE-EXISTING INSURANCE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT&#39;S EXACTLY RIGHT. I THINK THEY KIND OF FOOLED  THEMSELVES INTO BELIEVING THAT. AT THE SAME TIME I THINK  REPUBLICANS ARE WALKING INTO A  TRAP HERE. WHAT ARE THEY COMPLAINING ABOUT  RIGHT NOW THAT PEOPLE CAN&#39;T GET  ACCESS TO COVERAGE AND THAT  COVERAGE IS TOO EXPENSIVE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOW THEY WANT MORE PEOPLE  COVERED AND A CHEAPER RATE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU WANT TO EXPAND COVERAGE  AND YOU WANT PRICES TO GO DOWN. THERE&#39;S AN EASY WAY TO DO THAT. THERE&#39;S A COMPLICATED, DUMB WAY  TO DO IT WITH NEO-LIBERAL MARKET APPROACH BUT ANOTHER EASY WAY TO DO IT. BOTH INVOLVE MORE GOVERNING.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S HOLDING THEM ACCOUNT  ABLE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHAT HE SAYS IS IMPORTANT. WHAT YOU SEE IS A LITTLE OF  SNIPING ABOUT WHAT&#39;S OUT THERE. YOU DON&#39;T SEE REPUBLICANS COMING FORWARD WITH ANYTHING THEY WANT  TO OFFER AS THEIR OWN PLAN.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SOMEONE WROTE TODAY  REPUBLICAN PARTY IS A POST  POLICY PARTY. YOU CAN CLAIM RYAN HAS A BUDGET. I DON&#39;T THINK IT&#39;S A BUDGET.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; PAUL RYAN.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THEY HAVE OFFERED NO  ALTERNATIVE. NO ALTERNATIVE TO THE ACA HEALTH OBAMA CARE. SO I THINK THEY NEED TO BE HELD  DEEPLY ACCOUNT ABLE. IT IS JUST INSANE THEY HAVE GONE FROM FIGHTING TO SHUT DOWN THE  GOVERNMENT IN A DEFAULT,  HOLDING, DEFUNDING, GUTTING  OBAMA CARE AND NOW THEY ARE  CLAIMING THEY WANT ALL OF THIS. I THINK IT&#39;S IMPORTANT TO LOOK  AT THE STATES BY THE WAY. WHAT YOU WERE SAYING ABOUT  PREMIUMS FALLING. IN NEW YORK CITY PREMIUMS HAVE  FALLEN BY SOME 50%. IN STATES LIKE KENTUCKY. KENTUCKY OF.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR WHO  DECIDED TO WORK WITH FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; KENTUCKY WILL BE AN  INTERESTING PETRI DISH FOR A LOT OF REASONS. LETS HOPE MITCH McCONNELL GETS  BEAT BY A TEA PARTIER.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE&#39;RE NOT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; MY HUSBAND&#39;S STATE, NEW DEAL  TIME, DECADES AGO, A DEMOCRATIC  STATE. LETS SEE HOW GOVERNMENT LOOKS IN A STATE WHERE THE STATE EXCHANGE WORKS. I THINK RYAN IS RIGHT AND YOU&#39;RE RIGHT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION  WAS RIGHTLY BANKING ON THIS  REFORM THREADING AND WEAVING  ITSELF INTO PEOPLE&#39;S LIVES. THEN SOCIAL SECURITY ALSO TOOK  DECADES. SOCIAL SECURITY CAME UNDER  ATTACK --  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; PRESCRIPTION HEALTH PROGRAM. THE PRESCRIPTION HEALTH PROGRAM  WAS A DISASTER WHEN IT HAPPENED. IT TOOK A LONG TIME. WE&#39;RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO SEE  TWEAKS OF THE PROCESS OVER AND  OVER AGAIN, EXTENSIONS THERE,  DELAYS TO HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT&#39;S GOING ON. PART OF THE HEALTHY PROCESS, A  GOOD PART.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LET ME SAY ONE THING. I THINK IT&#39;S A GOOD PART OF THE  PROCESS IF IT ACTUALLY HAPPENS. THERE&#39;S A POLITICAL BET  HAPPENING RIGHT NOW, RYAN. IT&#39;S NOT A TERRIBLY PROFOUND  THING TO POINT OUT. REPUBLICANS ARE BETTING -- I  THINK BRIAN BOILER MAKES THE  SAME POINT, REPUBLICANS ARE  BETTING MIDDLE CLASS  PREDOMINANTLY MALE,  PREDOMINANTLY WHITE FOLKS KICKED OFF THESE CATASTROPHIC PLANS ARE GOING TO BE MORE VOCAL AND MORE  ORGANIZED AND MORE OUTRAGED THAN ALL THE POOR PEOPLE GETTING  HELPED BY THIS LAW, WHO TEND TO  BE VOICELESS IN THE POLITICAL  SPECTRUM. THEY THINK IN 2014 AND 2016 THAT WILL BENEFIT THEM.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK THEY ARE PROBABLY  RIGHT IN THE SHORT-TERM. BUT IN THE LONG-TERM, YOU NOW  HAVE THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE UPSET  ABOUT THE PRICE OF HEALTH CARE  AND BLAMING GOVERNMENT ABOUT IT. THAT MEANS THEY ARE GOING TO  TURN TO THE GOVERNMENTS FOR A  SOLUTION. THE SOLUTION THERE IS EITHER  MORE HEAVILY SUBSIDIZE THESE  EXCHANGES OR EXPAND ACCESS TO  MEDICARE. SO THEY ARE GOING TO WALK RIGHT  INTO THAT. ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU&#39;RE GOING TO  HAVE A BIGGER CONSTITUENCY FOR  SOMETHING LIKE MEDICARE FOR ALL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK THERE HAVE BEEN  MOMENTS DURING THESE HEARINGS  WHERE YOU ACTUALLY SEE DEMOCRATS SPEAK THE TRUTH. THIS IS ONE. LETS TAKE A LISTEN.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO  ABOUT THE APPROXIMATELY 17  MILLION CHILDREN WITH  PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS WHO CAN  NO LONGER BE DENIED HEALTH  INSURANCE COVERAGE? YOU WANT TO GO BACK? YOU WANT TO SAY YOU ARE NO  LONGER COVERED ANY LONGER. YOU GOING TO TELL THE PARENTS OF THOSE KIDS? WHICH ONE OF YOU IS GOING TO  STAND UP AND TELL THE PARENTS OF THOSE CHILDREN THE GAME IS OVER, SORRY, THAT WAS JUST A PHASE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WILL THE GENTLEMAN YIELD? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YES, I WILL.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S IT, RIGHT? IT&#39;S ABOUT THE PARENTS OF THOSE  CHILDREN STANDING UP. IT&#39;S ABOUT THE POOR PEOPLE THAT  HAVE BEEN DENIED. IT&#39;S ABOUT PEOPLE WITH  PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS DENIED  COVERAGE. SOME HUGE PART OF THIS IS  ANECDOTAL. SOME PART OF ANECDOTES WILL KICK IN UNTIL PEOPLE CAN SIGN UP FOR  STUFF ON THE WEBSITE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THIS MAY SOUND 30,000 FEET. FOR A LONG TIME WE&#39;VE BEEN  SEEING OUR ECONOMY TILT TOWARDS  A CERTAIN HIGHLY PRIVILEGED  CLASS THAT GETS EVERYTHING WHILE THE BROAD MIDDLE CLASS AND LOWER MIDDLE CLASS IS FURTHER AND  FURTHER LEFT BEHIND. THIS IS THE FIRST MAJOR REVERSAL OF THAT TREND. IT&#39;S NOT JUST ABOUT KIDS WITH  PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, IT&#39;S  ABOUT REESTABLISHING A DIFFERENT SOCIAL CONTRACT WITH AMERICAN  FAMILIES AND WORKERS ACROSS A  BROAD SPECTRUM THAT BEGINS TO  CONNECT DIFFERENT ENDS OF  AMERICAN SOCIETY. THAT&#39;S WHY IT&#39;S SO IMPORTANT  DEFINING LEGACY BUILDING STEP  FOR THE ADMINISTRATION. TOO BAD IT&#39;S BEEN SUCH A  HORRIBLE ROLLOUT. IT REALLY IS NOT JUST ABOUT KIDS AND THE POOR. IT&#39;S ABOUT THE AMERICAN MIDDLE  CLASS THAT&#39;S GOING TO CONTINUE  TO SEE THEIR JOBS UNDER STRESS,  CONTINUE TO SEE THE KINDS OF  THINGS SHORED UP, QUALITY OF  LIFE THEY HAD COME UNDONE. I THINK IT&#39;S VERY, VERY  IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THIS ISN&#39;T JUST ABOUT SMALL SEGMENTS OF  AMERICAN SOCIETY, EVEN THOUGH  THAT WAS A VERY PASSIONATE AND  COMPELLING COMMENT FROM THE  CONGRESSMAN.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S VERY IMPORTANT I THINK  TO LEAD WITH CHILDREN. NO, IT HAS GREAT POLITICAL  IMPACT. STEVE IS RIGHT. OUR COUNTRY NOW IS VERY LOW IN  TERMS OF SOCIAL MOBILITY, UPWARD MOBILE, PART OF THE AMERICAN  DREAM. PART OF THE REFORM, HEALTH CARE  REFORM WAS TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO MOVE TO JOBS THEY MIGHT  NOT OTHERWISE CONSIDER. SO MUCH WAS DEPENDENT ON DID IT  HAVE HEALTH CARE. YEARS AGO, ALL OF YOU WILL  REMEMBER THIS, U.S. AUTOMAKERS  AT ONE POINT TOYED WITH SINGLE  PAYER MEDICARE OR HEALTH CARE  REFORM BECAUSE OF THE  COMPETITIVENESS. THE U.S. ECONOMY IS LESS  COMPETITIVE BECAUSE OF THE  UNENLIGHTENED BUSINESS CLASS,  UNWILLINGNESS TO UNDERSTAND YOU  NEED TO BUILD A PARTNERSHIP  ACROSS SOCIETY IF YOU&#39;RE GOING  TO BE COMPETITIVE IN A GLOBAL  ECONOMY. I THINK ON MANY LEVELS CHILDREN, PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, WOMEN  SHOULD BE SPEAKING UP. THAT&#39;S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS HEALTH CARE PLAN.

HOUSE AND SENATE BUDGET  COMMITTEES SCHEDULED TO MEET  TOMORROW. ACCORDING TO TERMS OF OCTOBER  17th DEAL TO FUND THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT COMMITTEES HAVE UNTIL DECEMBER 13th FOR A LONG-TERM  BUNDLE AND JANUARY 15th TO COME  UP WITH A DEAL, ANY DEAL, TO  PREVENT ANOTHER SHUTDOWN AND  AVOID MORE AUTOMATIC SEQUESTER  CUTS. PERHAPS UNSURPRISINGLY THE  LATEST QUEST FOR ELUSIVE GRAND  BARGAIN MAY BE FALLING APART. SPEAKING TO &quot;POLITICO&quot; HOUSE  BUDGET COMMITTEE CHAIR,  AMERICA&#39;S WORKOUT KING, WE&#39;RE  SHOWING THAT PICTURE OF HIM  WORKING OUT, THREW ICE WATER  TELLING &quot;POLITICO&quot; WE NEED TO  FOCUS ON ACHIEVABLE GOALS. IF WE SPEND OUR TIME FAULKING  ABOUT A GRAND BARGAIN WE WILL  FALL FAR SHORT. THAT WILL REQUIRE EACH PARTY  COMPROMISING THEIR CORE  PRINCIPLES. IN THIS DIVIDED GOVERNMENT WE&#39;RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT. IN AN INTERVIEW WITH NEVADA  RADIO KNPR HARRY REID IDENTIFIED THE MAIN OBSTACLE TO SUCH A  DEAL.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THEY HAVE THEIR MIND-SET ON  DOING NOTHING, NOTHING MORE ON  REVENUE. UNTIL THEY GET OFF THAT KICK,  THERE&#39;S NOT GOING TO BE GRAND  BARGAIN, THERE&#39;S NOT GOING TO BE A SMALL BARGAIN.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BEHIND THE SCENES, A SMALL  DEAL, CALL IT A MINI BARGAIN,  SEEMS TO BE DEVELOPING. ASKED IF REVENUE WOULD BE  REQUIRED TO UNWIND SEQUESTRATION CUTS, THE PRESIDENT SIMPLY  RESPONDED NO. OKLAHOMA CONGRESSMAN TOM COLE,  ONE OF THE LAST OF THE REMAINING REPUBLICAN MODERATES ALSO  SIGNALED A WILLINGNESS TO GIVE  SOME GROUND.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BOTH SIDES WOULD LIKE TO DEAL WITH THE SEQUESTER AND WE&#39;RE  WILLING TO PUT MORE REVENUE ON  THE TABLE TO DO THAT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; JOINING US IS CONGRESSIONAL  REPORTER FOR &quot;POLITICO&quot; JAKE  SHERMAN. JAKE, IT&#39;S NOT A GRAND BARGAIN,  A MINI BARGAIN, CAN WE LOOK  FORWARD TO THAT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHAT COLE SAID IS RIGHT. BOTH SIDES WANT TO TAKE CARE OF  THE SEQUESTER. HOW THEY TAKE CARE OF IT IS A  BIG QUESTION. BEHIND THE SCENES WHAT  REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP SAYS IS  BASICALLY THIS, THIS ALL DEPENDS ON PAUL RYAN, WHAT HE WANTS TO  DO. DOES HE WANT TO BE PRESIDENT IN  DOES HE WANT TO CHAIR WAYS AND  MEANS OR DOES HE WANT TO BE  SPEAKER. WHAT DRIVES HIM WILL DRIVE THIS  PROCESS. I THINK WE HAVE TO ALSO KEEP IN  MIND THIS THING HAS FALLEN APART HOW MANY TIMES SINCE 2010? THEY HAVE TRIED THIS IN 2011,  &#39;12, AND &#39;13. THERE&#39;S A REASON THESE TWO SIDES THAT OBAMA AND BOEHNER CAN&#39;T  COME TO AN AGREEMENT. THOSE OBSTACLES, WHICH YOU KIND  OF DESCRIBED AT THE TOP, HAVEN&#39;T DISAPPEARED. THE DYNAMICS HAVEN&#39;T REALLY  CHANGED. IN FACT, WHAT RYAN IS SAYING  THEY HAVE KIND OF GOTTEN WORSE. THEY ARE GOING TO AIM FOR A  GRAND BARGAIN.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; PAUL RYAN WANTS TO KEEP ROOM  ON THE PLAYING FIELD IN CASE HE  WANTS TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. ON THIS NOTE AMERICA&#39;S WORKOUT  KING WAS DEALT A LITTLE BLOW WHO SAID AT ONE POINT ABOUT RYAN&#39;S  CHANCES IN 2013, SOMETIMES  YOU&#39;VE GOT TO RECOGNIZE THAT  SOMEONE ELSE ON YOUR TEAM HAS A  BETTER CHANCE, PAUL RYAN, AND  YOUR ROLE IS TO BE BLOCKER. YOU DON&#39;T ALWAYS HAVE TO BE A  QUARTERBACK. GOOD LINEMEN ARE HARD TO FIND. JAKE, SITTING ASIDE THE  METAPHORS OF RYAN BEING A  QUARTERBACK OR LINEMAN, PAUL  RYAN HAS PUT THE KIBOSH ON ANY  MAJOR DEAL SINCE HE CAME TO  PROMINENCE, VOTED AGAINST  SIMPSON-BOWLES, BOEHNER, SINGLE  HANDEDLY BLEW UP A BIPARTISAN  SENATE DEAL. WHY IS THERE ANY REASON TO  BELIEVE AT THIS POINT HE WOULD  DO ANYTHING TO HELP MOVE ALONG A BARGAIN OF ANY KIND? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE&#39;S IN THE DRIVER&#39;S  SEAT AND HIS HANDS ARE ON THIS  PROCESS IN A WAY THEY PREVIOUSLY HAVEN&#39;T BEEN. HE&#39;S NOT BURDENED BY A  PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION COMING UP  IN 2014, BECAUSE THERE IS NO  PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN 2014. THERE&#39;S SOME REASON TO BELIEVE  HE HAS A LITTLE MORE ROOM TO  WIGGLE. LISTEN, THE BEST OUTCOME OUT OF  THIS SITUATION, A LOT OF PEOPLE  THINK, IS TO DEVELOP A NUMBER TO FUND THE GOVERNMENT THROUGH 2014 AND MAYBE SHIFT SOME MONEY  AROUND SO SEQUESTRATION DOESN&#39;T  HIT AS HARD. OBVIOUSLY THERE&#39;S ANOTHER ROUND  OF SEQUESTRATION COMING IN  JANUARY. IF THEY CAN MESS WITH THAT AND  GET IT INTO BETTER SHAPE SO IT  DOESN&#39;T HIT AS DEEPLY AT $967  BILLION IT&#39;S GOING TO CUT PRETTY DEEP INTO THE GOVERNMENT, THAT  WOULD BE A SUCCESS. WE&#39;RE NOT TALKING ABOUT SOCIAL  SECURITY REFORM OR MEDICARE  REFORM OR MEDICAID REFORM EVEN  TAX REFORM. THOSE THINGS ARE NOT GOING TO  HAPPEN FOR THE REASONS WE JUST  DESCRIBED. GETTING A NUMBER TO FUND THROUGH 2014 AND AVOIDING KIND OF THE  HARSH REALITIES OF SEQUESTRATION WOULD BE GOOD GOALS ACCORDING TO REPUBLICANS AND EVEN SOME  DEMOCRATS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, RYAN, I KIND OF  THINK GETTING RID OF  SEQUESTRATION, EVEN IF IT MEANS  NO REVENUE, MIGHT BE A GOOD  DEAL. THE ASSUMPTION HAS ALWAYS BEEN  REPUBLICANS WOULD BE HURT SO  BADLY BY DEFENSE CUTS WE CAN  EXTRACT SOMETHING. RAND PAUL DOESN&#39;T CARE ABOUT THE DEFENSE CUTS. WHY DON&#39;T WE JETTISON SOME OF  THE CRAP, SPEAKING ABOUT DEFENSE CUTS. HE WANTS MORE DEFENSE CUTS. THE IDEA THIS IS SOMEHOW  LEVERAGED IS MAYBE NOT THAT  ACCURATE. IF YOU CAN UNWIND SEQUESTRATION  OR PUT IN A BETTER BARGAIN, IF  YOU WILL, AND NOT GET REVENUE,  IT STILL MIGHT BE A GOOD DEAL  FOR DEMOCRATS AT THIS POINT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOT A GOOD BARGAIN FOR THE  TEA PARTY. IF YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR A SIGN  OF HOW MUCH LESS POWER THE TEA  PARTY HAS NOW, LOOK AT WHAT TOM  COLE SAID, BOTH SIDES WON. HE SAID MORE REVENUE, HIGHER  TAXES, IF THEY CAN DO AWAY WITH  SEQUESTER, WHICH IS MORE  SPENDING. THAT&#39;S A REPUBLICAN SAYING,  OKAY, WE&#39;LL TAKE HIGHER TAXES  AND MORE SPENDING. THE TEA PARTY IS LOOKING LIKE IT WILL GET RAILROADED ON THIS  BECAUSE A LOT OF REPUBLICANS DO  CARE ABOUT PENTAGON SPENDING. $25 BILLION IS COMING OUT OF THE PENTAGON NEXT YEAR AND THEY ARE  ALREADY CARPING ABOUT THE $50  BILLION THAT HIT THIS YEAR. SO THEY THINK THEY NEED $50  BILLION BACK. THEY DON&#39;T WANT TO GIVE UP  ANOTHER 25. SO YOU&#39;RE RIGHT. DEMOCRATS HAVE A LOT OF  LEVERAGE. THAT&#39;S WHAT HARRY REID WAS  SAYING RECENTLY. THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE  LEVERAGE. THEY CAN EVEN GET TACKS OUT OF  THIS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK I WAS ARGUING A  COUNTER-POINT. THE IDEA, STEVE, OF HOW MUCH  SWAY THE TEA PARTY HAS AT THIS  POINT, I THINK THE JURY IS STILL OUT. YOU HAVE TOM COLE, WHO HAS BEEN  A MODERATE BASICALLY ALL ALONG  BUT FORCED AT SPECIFIC MOMENTS  DURING THE SHUTDOWN AND AFTER  THE FACT TO GO ALONG WITH  FRACTIOUS STRATEGY THAN HE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED. I WONDER JUST WHERE THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY WILL FIND ITS  CENTER.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LET ME PUT AN UNCOMFORTABLE  TRUTH OUT THERE. IT&#39;S NOT JUST THE TEA PARTY  DRIVING THIS PROCESS. FISCAL CONSERVATIVES IN THE  DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND REPUBLICAN  PARTY THAT LOOK AT THE FACT THAT FISCAL SOLVENCY REALLY MATTERS  TO THEM, WHETHER THAT&#39;S THE  RIGHT POLICY TO PURSUE IS A  DIFFERENT QUESTION. I THINK THEY ARE LOOKING AT THE  SEQUESTER AS SOMETHING THAT&#39;S  ACHIEVING CUTS. IT&#39;S WORKING AWAY. IT&#39;S EATING AWAY AT WHAT THEY  SEE THE LARGESSE OF GOVERNMENT. WHAT I FIND INTERESTING IS I  CAN&#39;T FIND A LEADER IN CONGRESS  THAT SAYS WE SHOULDN&#39;T PASS SOME WAY TO MAKE IT FLEXIBLE. WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GIVE THE  DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE OR OFFICE  OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET  FLEXIBILITY HOW TO APPLY ACROSS  ACCOUNTS. IT&#39;S A SHARP BLUDGEON THAT CUTS  ACROSS. NO ONE SAYS THEY ARE AGAINST IT. YET EVERY TIME THAT LANGUAGE  GETS IN, IT MYSTERIOUSLY  DISAPPEARS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT&#39;S BECAUSE  THERE&#39;S A TERROR THAT IF YOU  ACCEPT YOU CAN MAYBE  AGREE/COMPROMISE ON SOMETHING. FOR REPUBLICANS THAT MEANS  REVENUES AND FOR DEMOCRATS THAT  MEANS SLASHING SOCIAL SAFETY  NET.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I DO THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE  IN CONGRESS, FOR EXAMPLE, THE  PROGRESSIVE CAUCUS IN THE HOUSE  HAS PUT FORWARD STATEMENTS ON  OPPOSING SEQUESTRATION JUST  STRAIGHT OUT AND A BUDGET THAT  IS ABOUT NOT HOW MUCH TO CUT BUT INVESTMENT. SEEMS TO ME AGAIN DEEP  STRUCTURAL. THE PROBLEM IS WE&#39;RE AT A MOMENT IN THE COUNTRY WITH A FALTERING  ECONOMY WHERE 95% OF THE IN COME GAIN SINCE THE RECESSION TOP 1%. IF WE WANT TO BE A SECURE,  HEALTHY, COMPETITIVE NATION, WE  SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT BEST  PLAN, PUTTING PEOPLE BACK TO  WORK. JOBLESSNESS NOT DEFICITS IS THE  GREATEST CRISIS. THAT DOESN&#39;T SEEM TO BE PART OF  THE BELTWAY DISCUSSION EXCEPT  FOR THOSE THAT DON&#39;T HAVE POWER. THE TEA PARTY, I THINK YOU&#39;RE  RIGHT, HAS LOST A LOT OF ITS  POWER, WHICH IS THE BEGINNING OF POSSIBILITY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU WANTED TO GET IN ON THAT  LAST POINT ABOUT REVENUE VERSUS  ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS, SOCIAL  SAFETY NET, EARNED BENEFIT  PROGRAMS, WHATEVER, HOWEVER YOU  WANT TO CHARACTERIZE THEM. I&#39;LL LET YOU GO AHEAD.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND, IT  MATTERS NOT AT ALL WHAT TOM  COLE, JOHN BOEHNER SAYS, MITCH  McCONNELL SAYS, BECAUSE NOBODY  LISTEN TOSS THEM. I DON&#39;T CARE IF TOM COLE IS  MODERATE OR WHATEVER HE IS, OR  JOHN BOEHNER, LIKE HE SAYS,  WE&#39;RE NOT GOING TO SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT. THE POCKET OF CONSERVATIVES  RUNNING THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN  CONFERENCE DON&#39;T LISTEN TO WHAT  THEIR LEADERSHIP SAYS. TOM COLE COULD WANT TO RAISE TAX TOSS 50% AND THAT DOESN&#39;T REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU&#39;RE SAYING NO LESSONS HAVE BEEN LEARNED SINCE THE SHUTDOWN. THE ORIENTATION OF POWER HAS  SHIFTED EVEN FURTHER TOWARD THE  RIGHT TOWARDS THE TEA PARTY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK IT HAS. I THINK SOME PEOPLE HAVE LEARNED LESSONS. YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER REPUBLICAN  LEADERSHIP LIKES TO DOWNPLAY  THIS. THESE ARE JUST 30, 40 PEOPLE OFF THE RESERVATION, TOO  CONSERVATIVE. THAT DOESN&#39;T MATTER. YOU NEED 218 VOTES TO PASS  SOMETHING. IF JOHN BOEHNER WANTS TO KEEP  HIS SPEAKERSHIP, HE HAS TO TAKE  THAT INTO CONSIDERATION. I CAN HEAR RYAN SIGHING THERE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LOOK WHO PROVIDED THE 218.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I&#39;M WITH YOU.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOT THE TEA PARTY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT IS ONLY AFTER JOHN  BOEHNER LET HIS TEA PARTIERS  SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT AND  BRING THE U.S. ECONOMY TO THE  VERGE OF CATASTROPHE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CORRECT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; JAKE, ONE LAST QUESTION. TOM COBURN, DO PEOPLE LISTEN TO  WHAT HE HAS TO SAY. HE SAID THE OTHER DAY, TOIF SAY  THIS, THERE IS NO COMEDY WITH  HARRY REID. I THINK HE&#39;S AN ABSOLUTE A HOLE. FOR THOSE OF US WHO WATCH  WASHINGTON POLITICS ARE SORT OF  SAD AND SEE THESE AS GRAY, DARK  DAYS, THAT SEEMS LIKE A NEW LOW. IS THAT PAR FOR THE COURSE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I CAN&#39;T SPEAK OF WHAT MOST  THINK OF HARRY REID OR TOM  COBURN&#39;S RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM  BUT I&#39;LL BE SAFE AND SAY THERE&#39;S","media$content":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":500000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":632.366,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":240,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/4pl4NDwwLA6u?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":420,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":800000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":632.366,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":360,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/ihVoyEdXY10c?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":640,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":632.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":0,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/w_13ZJ_kgl6M?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":0,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"media$thumbnails":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"image","plfile$duration":0.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"JPEG","plfile$height":1080,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/131029/n_wag_2budget_131029.jpg","plfile$width":1920,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"link":"","pubDate":1383069540000,"plmedia$defaultThumbnailUrl":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/131029/n_wag_2budget_131029.jpg","nnd$associatedPlaylist":{"href":"http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_49745812"},"nnd$brand":"MSNBC","nnd$bureau":"30RockNY","nnd$bviAssetId":"n_wag_2budget_131029","nnd$canonicalUrl":{"href":"http://www.msnbc.com/now-with-alex-wagner/watch/battle-lines-being-drawn-for-budget-showdown-58212931614"},"nnd$distributionProfile":["MSN-CA"],"nnd$firstAiredAtUtc":1383063487000,"nnd$lastAiredAtUtc":1383063487000,"nnd$lastEditorialChangeAtUtc":1383069558000,"nnd$longTitle":"Battle lines being drawn for budget showdown","nnd$playCount30":2667,"nnd$playCountDay":13,"nnd$playCountYear":2658,"nnd$requiresCaptioning":true,"nnd$shortDescription":"With wounds still fresh from the shutdown, members of Congress grid for the next round of fiscal fights.

THE JUDGE APPOINTED BY GEORGE W. BUSH BLOCKED TEXAS FROM  ENFORCING RESTRICTION THAT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED DOCTORS PERFORMING ABORTIONS TO HAVE ADMITTING  PRIVILEGES AT A NEARBY HOSPITAL. HAD THE REQUIREMENT GONE INTO  EFFECT IT COULD FORCE CLINICS TO CLOSE. THE ACT IS WITHOUT A RATIONAL  BASIS, THE JUDGE WROTE AND  PLACES A SUBSTANTIAL OBSTACLE IN THE PATH OF A WOMAN SEEKING AN  ABORTION. &quot;NEW YORK TIMES&quot; HAILED THE  JUDGE&#39;S DECISION AS A VICTORY  FOR REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. IF IT WAS A VICTORY, IT WAS A  LOPSIDED ONE. IN THE JUDGE&#39;S RULING HE ALSO  LET STAND A PROVISION THAT  RESTRICTS CHOICE BY REQUIRING  DOCTORS TO USE A SPECIFIC DRUG  PROTOCOL AND MEDICATION, THE  MEDICATION-INDUCED ABORTIONS. A PROTOCOL DOCTORS AND MEDICAL  EXPERTS AND AMERICAN COLLEGE OF  OBJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND  GYNECOLOGISTS UPDATED. TEXAS ANNOUNCED THEY WOULD  APPEAL THE DECISION AND WOULD GO TO THE STAUNCHLY CONSERVATIVE  FIFTH COURT OF APPEALS. ACCORDING TO &quot;THE NEW YORK  TIMES&quot; EVEN THE JUDGE  ACKNOWLEDGED THE LIMITS OF HIS  RULING. QUOTE, AT THE END OF THE DAY,  THESE ISSUES ARE GOING TO BE  DECIDED DEFINITIVELY NOT BY THIS COURT BUT EITHER THE CIRCUIT OR  SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED  STATES. MELANIE, CEO OF THE  HOUSTON-BASED PLANNED PARENTHOOD CENTER FOR CHOICE. WELCOME TO THE SHOW, MELANIE,  AND THANKS FOR JOINING US.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, ALEX, FOR HAVING  ME.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LETS TALK ABOUT JUDGE YAKEL&#39;S DECISION. WHAT ARE THE PRACTICAL EFFECTS  OF THIS FOR WOMEN IN TEXAS AND  NATIONALLY. WE KNOW NINE OTHER STATES  INCLUDING TEXAS HAVE PASSED LAWS REQUIRING DOCTORS PERFORMING  ABORTION TO HAVE ADMITTING  PRIVILEGES. DOES THIS CHANGE THE DYNAMIC  NATIONALLY AT ALL? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU KNOW, THIS RULING  REALLY IS A VICTORY FOR OUR  PATIENTS. IT&#39;S A VICTORY FOR WOMEN, TO  PASS LAWS THAT RESTRICT THE VERY PRIVATE, PERSONAL HEALTH CARE  DECISIONS WOMEN MAKE IN PERSONAL CONSULTATION WITH THEIR HEALTH  CARE DECISIONS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt;&gt; NOT TO RAIN ON A VICTORY BUT IT IS WORTH NOTING A FEW MOMENTS AGO TEXAS ATTORNEY GENERAL GREG  ABBOTT ASKED FOR AN APPEALS  COURT TO ISSUE AN ORDER TO  REINSTATE THE RESTRICTION, WHICH THEY STRUCK DOWN ON MONDAY. THE LITIGATION ON THIS  CONTINUES. I THINK AS JUDGE YAEKEL MADE  MENTION OF IN HIS DECISION, THE  ULTIMATE END FOR THIS IS THE  SUPREME COURT. IF IT IS THE SUPREME COURT, HOW  OPTIMISTIC ARE YOU THAT THIS MAY BE UPHELD OR STRUCK DOWN? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU KNOW, WE KNEW THAT  THE STATE WOULD APPEAL. WE ARE IN THIS FIGHT FOR THE  LONG RUN, BECAUSE WOMEN ARE  FAMILIES ARE DEPENDING ON US. WE WOULD HOPE THAT BOTH THE  APPELLATE COURT AND IF IT GETS  TO THE SUPREME COURT, THAT ALL  OF THOSE JUDGES AND JUSTICES  WOULD LOOK AT MORE THAN 40 YEARS OF SUPREME COURT RULINGS THAT  UPHOLD A WOMAN&#39;S RIGHT TO ACCESS SAFE, LEGAL ABORTION.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; KATRINA, MELANIE MAKES A VERY IMPORTANT POINT, WHICH IS THE  JUDICIAL PRECEDENT HERE. I THINK IT&#39;S AMAZING A  CONSERVATIVE JUDGE APPOINTED BY  GEORGE W. BUSH STRIKES THIS LAW  DOWN SAYING THE ACTSDMITTING  PRIVILEGES ARE WITHOUT A  RATIONAL BASIS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LETS NOT FORGET PRESIDENT  NIXON UNDERSTOOD THEALUE OF  FAMILY PLANNING. HAVE YOU A REPUBLICAN PARTY  TODAY WHICH HAS LOST ALL SIGHT  OF THAT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WOMEN HAVE SUFFRAGE, I THINK. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THIS REPUBLICAN PARTY MAY NOT KNOW. THAT&#39;S AN IMPORTANT POINT  BECAUSE WOMEN WILL VOTE. I MODERATED A PANEL WITH A YOUNG LATINA THAT RUNS AT TEXAS STATE  UNIVERSITY. SHE SPOKE OF HOW IN THESE LAST  MONTHS ESPECIALLY SINCE WENDY  DAVIS AND HER FILIBUSTER, SCORES AND SCORES OF YOUNG WOMEN, YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE MOBILIZED TO RECLAIM THEIR RIGHTS AND FIGHT THIS  FIERCE ANTI-CHOICE POLITICS. WE HEARD ABOUT THE LONG RUN. THIS IS GOING TO BE THE LONG RUN FIGHT. I HOPE WENDY DAVIS WINS. SHE MAY NOT WIN BUT WHAT SHE&#39;S  DOING IN THE RUN FOR GOVERNOR IS BUILDING AN INFRASTRUCTURE OF  NEW VOTERS, VOTERS WHO  UNDERSTAND CIVILIZATIONAL ASPECT OF PRO-CHOICE POLITICS. THERE&#39;S DANGER IN THE PRECEDENT. THERE&#39;S ALSO STUPIDITY IN A  STATE LIKE TEXAS OR  CASH-STRAPPED STATES TAKING  THESE CASES AND WASTING  TAXPAYERS&#39; MONEY PRAGMATICALLY  WHEN THE MONEY COULD BE INVESTED IN EDUCATION, IN ALL KINDS OF  BENEFITS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOT TO MENTION STRIPPING  FUNDING FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD  AND TAKING AWAY REPRODUCTIVE  HEALTH SERVICES FOR HUNDREDS OF  THOUSANDS OF LOW IN COME WOMEN  IN TEXAS. TO THE OTHER PART OF THE  DECISION, THE PART THE JUDGE LET STAND, THE PROVISION ABOUT  HAVING TO USE A CERTAIN MEDICAL  PROTOCOL. ACCORDING TO AN INSTITUTE  ONE-QUARTER BEFORE NINE WEEKS  ARE MEDICATION ABORTIONS. THAT WOULD SEEM TO HAVE SERIOUS  REPERCUSSIONS FOR THE WOMEN OF  TEXAS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YES. WE WERE DISAPPOINTED BY THAT  PART OF THE RULING, BUT BY AND  LARGE THIS IS STILL A VICTORY  FOR WOMEN. MEDICATION ABORTION IN THE  EVIDENCE-BASED PROTOCOL IS A  VERY SAFE, VERY EFFECTIVE WAY  FOR WOMEN TO END AN EARLY  PREGNANCY. WE&#39;RE DISAPPOINTED BY THAT PART  OF THE RULING. THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE  RULING IS THAT WHICH PRRVESERVES  ACCESS TO SAFE, LEGAL BORINGS  ACROSS TEXAS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION AS  A WOMAN IN TECH. WHEN THESE DECISIONS ARE HANDED  DOWN AT THE SAME TIME THERE&#39;S A  20-WEEK BAN ENACTED I BELIEVE  STARTING TODAY THAT CLINICS NOW  HAVE TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF AMBULATORY SURGICAL CENTERS. THESE PROVISIONS THAT SEEM  DESIGNED TO MAKE A VERY  DIFFICULT CHOICE THAT MUCH  HARDER. DO THE WOMEN OF TEXAS, SORT OF,  ARE THEY COALESCING AROUND THESE DECISIONS AND SAY THIS CAN&#39;T  HAPPEN. WE DON&#39;T DESERVE TO BE TREATED  LIKE THIS. OUR SISTERS AND MOTHERS AND  DAUGHTERS SHOULD NOT BE TREATED  LIKE THIS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. THE WOMEN OF TEXAS ARE PAYING  ATTENTION. THE WOMEN OF TEXAS HAVE WATCHED  AS GOVERNOR RICK PERRY AND OTHER TEXAS POLITICIANS HAVE FORCED  THE SHUTDOWN OF 76 WOMEN&#39;S  HEALTH CENTERS AROUND THE STATE  IN THE LAST TWO YEARS, SLASHED  HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF FAMILY PLANNING FUNDING, AND  CREATED REALLY DANGEROUS  CONSEQUENCES FOR REAL WOMEN AND  WOMEN ARE PAYING ATTENTION.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; MELANIE FROM PLANNED  PARENTHOOD CENTER FOR CHOICE IN","media$content":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":800000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":418.151,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":360,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/bjzm_KysZ0UK?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":640,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":500000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":418.151,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":240,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/iGPDJLqkgpcv?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":420,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":418.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":0,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/01RtgXVAzsOK?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":0,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"media$thumbnails":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"image","plfile$duration":0.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"JPEG","plfile$height":1080,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/131029/n_wag_3fem_131029.jpg","plfile$width":1920,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"link":"","pubDate":1383069300000,"plmedia$defaultThumbnailUrl":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/131029/n_wag_3fem_131029.jpg","nnd$associatedPlaylist":{"href":"http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_49748276"},"nnd$brand":"MSNBC","nnd$bureau":"30RockNY","nnd$bviAssetId":"n_wag_3fem_131029","nnd$canonicalUrl":{"href":"http://www.msnbc.com/now-with-alex-wagner/watch/the-fight-for-reproductive-rights-in-texas-58212931909"},"nnd$distributionProfile":["MSN-CA"],"nnd$firstAiredAtUtc":1383064704000,"nnd$lastAiredAtUtc":1383064704000,"nnd$lastEditorialChangeAtUtc":1383069351000,"nnd$longTitle":"The fight for reproductive rights in Texas","nnd$playCount30":2375,"nnd$playCountDay":19,"nnd$playCountYear":2361,"nnd$requiresCaptioning":true,"nnd$shortDescription":"A federal judge in Texas struck down a major part of the state’s restrictive new abortion law Monday, deeming it unconstitutional.","nnd$source":"NOW","nnd$sourceId":"nnd_45258737","nnd$sourceUrlSlug":"now-with-alex-wagner","nnd$titleUrlSlug":"the-fight-for-reproductive-rights-in-texas","nnd$videoType":"Broadcast","nnd$workbenchId":"53405570"},{"$xmlns":{"nnd":"http://partners.nbcnews.com/nnd_mrss"},"guid":"n_wag_4putin_131029","title":"Putin changing course on gay athletes?","author":"","description":"Despite signing a law banning gay propaganda, Russian President Vladimir Putin recently told reporters that gays and lesbians are welcome at the Winter Olympics.","media$availableDate":1383068820000,"media$expirationDate":4458908820000,"media$categories":[{"media$name":"Cable/Politics/All","media$scheme":"","media$label":""},{"media$name":"Cable/Society","media$scheme":"","media$label":""},{"media$name":"MSNBC/Issues/Society","media$scheme":"","media$label":""},{"media$name":"Cable/Equality/LGBT","media$scheme":"","media$label":""},{"media$name":"MSNBC/Issues/Equality/LGBT","media$scheme":"","media$label":""}],"media$copyright":"","media$copyrightUrl":"","media$credits":[],"media$keywords":"","media$ratings":[],"media$countries":[],"media$excludeCountries":true,"media$text":"&gt;&gt;&gt; RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR  PUTIN, THIS GUY, WE HAVE THE  GRAPHIC, THIS GUY, THAT GUY, MAY HAVE JUST RECENTLY SIGNED  HOMOPHOBIC LAW BANNING GAY  PROPAGANDA IN THE COUNTRY AND  ALLOWING POLICE OFFICERS TO  ARREST FOREIGN NATIONALS THEY  SUSPECT OF BEING HOMOSEXUAL OR  PRO GAY. NOW 100 DAYS UNTIL THE WINTER  OLYMPICS IN RUSSIA, PUTIN IS  TRYING TO TURN A PAGE KIND OF. YESTERDAY PUTIN TOLD REPORTERS  WE WILL MAKE SURE WE DO  EVERYTHING ATHLETES AND GUESTS  FEEL COMFORTABLE REGARDLESS OF  THEIR RACE, ETHNICITY, SEXUAL  ORIENTATION. I WOULD LIKE TO UNDERLINE THAT. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE REACTED TO  CONSTERNATION GIVEN LAWS PASSED  IN RUSSIA.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AS THEY SHOWED. AT THE SAME TIME, YOU HAVE TO  UNDERSTAND IT&#39;S NOT PUTIN, NOT  THE GUY ON HORSE BACK, IF I HAVE TO SEE THAT GUY ON HORSEBACK.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I CAN&#39;T GET ENOUGH.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; MAYBE SOCIETY, MAYBE  TELEVISION. THREE-FOURTHS OF RUSSIAN SOCIETY DOES NOT SUPPORT GAY RIGHTS. RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH HAS  BECOME POLITICS. THIS COUNTRY SHOULDN&#39;T BOYCOTT  SOICHI. ATHLETES SHOULD GO. THERE SHOULD BE WEARING OF  RAINBOW COLORS. THERE SHOULD BE PROTESTS, MORE  SPEECH. I WAS STRUCK ABOUT RUSSIA&#39;S LGTB SPORTS FEDERATION IS GOING TO  HOLD GAMES AFTER SOICHI. LET US SUPPORT EFFORTS AS WE  RIGHTLY CRITICIZES NOT ONLY  PUTIN BUT OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD WHERE LGTB RIGHTS ARE  UNDER SIEGE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; STEVE, YOU WERE SAYING YOU  HAVE FRIENDS IN RUSSIA.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I HAVE A LOT OF GAY FRIENDS  IN RUSSIA. THEY ARE ENGAGED IN GAY  ACTIVITIES. THEY CONTINUE TO ORGANIZE  PARADES, MARCHES, GAY RIGHTS  JUST MIKE MY FRIENDS IN TEXAS  DO. RICK PERRY NOT ONLY WITH WOMEN  IN THE LAST SEGMENT BUT IF YOU  LOOK AT RICK PERRY&#39;S CAMPAIGN  MATERIAL IT&#39;S REMARKABLE SIMILAR TO THE STATEMENTS OUT OF  VLADIMIR PUTIN. WE HAVE PROBLEMS IN THIS COUNTRY AS WELL. I AGREE WITH KATRINA, THE DEAL  IS TO BE ENGAYED WITH RUSSIA,  UNDERSTAND IT&#39;S GOING THROUGH  ITS OWN IDENTITY AND SOUL  SEARCHING ISSUES. FUNDAMENTALLY I HOPE EVERY  ATHLETE ON THE AMERICAN TEAM AND ALL THESE OTHER TEAMS DO ENGAGE  IN PROPAGANDA, DO ENGAGE IN  SHOWING THE GAY FLAG, BECAUSE I  THINK THAT THE WORLD NEEDS TO  SEE RUSSIA AS IT IS. BUT THAT IS THERE&#39;S A MIX OF  THINGS GOING THERE. IT&#39;S GOOD FOR RUSSIANS TO LOOK  AT SOMETHING THEY ARE BEING  GRADED ON BY THE REST OF THE  WORLD.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; REMEMBER THE 1936 OLYMPICS  WHERE JESSE OWENS WON THOSE  MEDALS. IT WAS SUCH A MEANINGFUL MOMENT  FOR THE WORLD, AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND REPUDIATION OF EVERYTHING  HITLER HAD BEEN ESPOUSING TO  HAVE GAY ATHLETES PERFORM AND  WIN SILVER, BRONZE MEDALS, TO  EVEN BE THERE IS IMPORTANT FOR  RUSSIA AS THE POPULATION SORT OF BEGINS TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY  REALLY THINK ABOUT LGTB RIGHTS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THIS WILL ULTIMATELY WHEN WE  LOOK BACK BE A SEMINAL MOMENT IN THE GLOBAL MARCH FOR GAY RIGHTS. WHAT&#39;S HAPPENING IN THE UNITED  STATES IS A GLOBAL PHENOMENON. YOU&#39;RE SEEING IN COUNTRIES FROM  COLUMBIA, FRANCE, BRITAIN,  SOUTHEAST ASIA, EVERYWHERE THERE ARE GAY RIGHTS MOVEMENTS  CROPPING UP, ROOTED IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY&#39;S TRADITIONS. IT&#39;S A DRAMATIC TRANSFORMATION  AND RUSSIA WON&#39;T BE WILL U.N. TO IT. THE CONFLICT YOU&#39;LL SEE IN  RUSSIA OVER THIS WILL THEN BE  SEEN BY THE ENTIRE WORLD. THAT WILL CONTINUE TO FURTHER  THESE MOVEMENTS. THE KIND OF THING AS YOU TALK  ABOUT IT, IT WINS. FREEDOM MARCHES GENERALLY  MARCHES FORWARD WHEN GIVEN A  FAIR DEBATE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; UNIVERSE IS LONG BUT BENDS  TOWARDS JUSTICE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IF GIVEN AN OPEN  CONVERSATION.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; DIALOGUE, ENGAGEMENT AS IT  WERE.","media$content":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":500000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":230.097,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":240,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/fr4wLQkHu6FF?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":420,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":800000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":230.097,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":360,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/24bnatORIifz?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":640,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":230.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":0,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/UE2WN5ZzmYT9?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":0,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"media$thumbnails":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"image","plfile$duration":0.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"JPEG","plfile$height":1080,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/131029/n_wag_4putin_131029.jpg","plfile$width":1920,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"link":"","pubDate":1383068820000,"plmedia$defaultThumbnailUrl":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/131029/n_wag_4putin_131029.jpg","nnd$associatedPlaylist":{"href":"http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_49748274"},"nnd$brand":"MSNBC","nnd$bureau":"30RockNY","nnd$bviAssetId":"n_wag_4putin_131029","nnd$canonicalUrl":{"href":"http://www.msnbc.com/now-with-alex-wagner/watch/putin-changing-course-on-gay-athletes-58212931907"},"nnd$distributionProfile":["MSN-CA"],"nnd$firstAiredAtUtc":1383065529000,"nnd$lastAiredAtUtc":1383065529000,"nnd$lastEditorialChangeAtUtc":1383068979000,"nnd$longTitle":"Putin changing course on gay athletes?","nnd$playCount30":1728,"nnd$playCountDay":11,"nnd$playCountYear":1720,"nnd$requiresCaptioning":true,"nnd$shortDescription":"Despite signing a law banning gay propaganda, Russian President Vladimir Putin recently told reporters that gays and lesbians are welcome at the Winter Olympics.","nnd$source":"NOW","nnd$sourceId":"nnd_45258737","nnd$sourceUrlSlug":"now-with-alex-wagner","nnd$titleUrlSlug":"putin-changing-course-on-gay-athletes","nnd$videoType":"Broadcast","nnd$workbenchId":"53405647"},{"$xmlns":{"nnd":"http://partners.nbcnews.com/nnd_mrss"},"guid":"n_wag_2fire_131028","title":"Rethinking the Bush-Cheney relationship","author":"","description":"Peter Baker and the NOW panel discuss Baker’s new book “Days of Fire,” which explores the political partnership between George W.

IN FACT, HE MAY NOT EVEN HAVE  THE SAME HEART HE STARTED OUT  WITH BUT FORMER VICE PRESIDENT  DICK CHENEY IS ONCE AGAIN IN THE LIMELIGHT AND STILL BEATING THE  DRUMS OF WAR. YESTERDAY ON ABC CHENEY GAVE A  HARSH ASSESSMENT OF THE OBAMA  ADMINISTRATION&#39;S POLICY IN THE  MIDDLE EAST.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK OUR FRIENDS NO LONGER COUNT ON US, NO LONGER TRUST US, NOR ADVERSARIES FEAR US. 9/11, SAUDIS, EGYPTIANS, MANY IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD NO LONGER HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE UNITED  STATES.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CHENEY ALSO THREW IN HIS TWO  CENTS ON THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK IT&#39;S VERY IMPORTANT  WE BRING IN A NEW GENERATION OF  LEADERSHIP. I THINK AFTER THE PRESIDENTIAL  ELECTION LAST YEAR, WE GOT  WHIPPED. THERE&#39;S A LOT OF WORK TO BE  DONE, NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOT JUST THE TELEVISION  SPOTLIGHT, A NEW BOOK &quot;DAYS OF  FIRE&quot; CLOSELY EXAMINES THE BUSH  ADMINISTRATION AND CHENEY&#39;S  RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DESIRE. IN THE BOOK BAKER DETAILS THE  DECISION MAKING BEHIND WAR IN  IRAQ, GUANTANAMO, EXPANSION OF  THE NATIONAL SECURITY STATE AND  HURRICANE KATRINA. WHILE CHENEY WAS NO DOUBT A  POWERFUL FORCE IN THE WHITE  HOUSE, HE DISPELS THE MYTH AS  DICK CHENEY&#39;S PUPPET. HE WAS UNQUESTIONABLY THE MOST  INFLUENTIAL VICE PRESIDENT IN  AMERICAN HISTORY. BUT HE SUBORDINATED HIMSELF TO  BUSH THE WAY NO OTHER VICE  PRESIDENT HAS DONE. FOREGOING ANY INDEPENDENT  ASPIRATION TO RUN HIMSELF TO  MAKE HIS PRESIDENCY SUCCESSFUL. IN TURN HE GAVE HIM ACCESS TO  EVERY MEETING AND EVERY  DECISION. PETER, YOU ALL -- I HOPE OUR  MICS WERE NOT ON DURING THE  BREAK. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS BOOK. ATMOSPHERE PHENOMENAL PIECE OF  JOURNALISM, A GREAT READ. I THINK I&#39;M NOT DONE WITH IT,  I&#39;M NOT EVEN HALFWAY DONE WITH  IT BUT I THINK IT WILL BE THE  DEFINITIVE BOOK ON THE BUSH ERA. CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I APPRECIATE THAT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOW THAT I&#39;VE BUTTERRED YOU  UP. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT ONE OF THE  THESIS LAID OUT IN THE  BEGINNING. IN TERM ONE THESE TWO MEN WERE  FAIRLY CLOSE. NOT IN TERMS OF FRIENDSHIP BUT  IN TERMS OF DECISION MAKING. BY THE END OF THE BUSH ERA, I&#39;LL QUOTE THE BOOK. BY THE TIME BUSH AND CHENEY  STEPPED OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE  FOR THE FINAL TIME, THEY HAD  DISAGREED ON NORTH KOREA, GUN  RIGHTS, SAME-SEX MARRIAGE, TAX  CUTS, GUANTANAMO, INTERROGATION  PRACTICES, SURVEILLANCE  PRACTICES IRAN, CLIMATE CHANGE  LEBANON WAR HARRIET MEYERS,  MIDDLE EAST PEACE, SYRIA,  RUSSIA, FEDERAL SPENDING. ALMOST EVERY MATTER OF IMPORT  THEY NEVER SAW EYE TO EYE ON.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YEAH. IT WAS A DRAMATICALLY EVOLVED  RELATIONSHIP. CHENEY WAS IMPORTANT IN THE  BEGINNING. NEVER QUITE AS SINGLE MINDEDLY  THE PUPPET MASTER SOME PEOPLE  MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT. BUT BY THE END THEY HAD DRIFTED  APART. PRESIDENT BUSH WANTED TO TRY  MORE DIPLOMACY IN HIS SECOND  TERM. HE DID WANT TO REBUILD RES WITH  THE ALLIES AS WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE LAST SEGMENT HE TRIED TO  MODERATE TO THE SOME EXTENT SOME COUNTER-TERRORISM POLICIES THAT  CAUSED CONTROVERSY. VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY WORRIED  THAT WAS GETTING AWAY FROM WHAT  WAS MOST IMPORTANT, WORRIED IT  WAS AWAY FROM THE PRINCIPLES  THEY DEVELOPED IN THE BEGINNING  AFTER 9/11 AND RESISTED A LOT OF THESE CHANGES. ALTHOUGH AS HE SAID PUBLICLY IN  THESE LAST FEW DAYS, HE DIDN&#39;T  ALWAYS WIN.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ONE OF THE THINGS YOU MAKE  NOTE OF IS THE WAY IN WHICH  CHENEY DEALT WITH BUSH, WHICH  WAS NOT TO MAKE HIM FEEL LIKE A  FOOL OR HE WAS BEING PUPPETEERED BUT MANIPULATE HIM IN A WAY. MANIPULATE IS PROBABLY THE WRONG WORD. COERCE HIM. MAYBE THAT&#39;S THE WRONG WORD. TO GET HIM TO EMBRACE THESE  POLICIES. ONE OF THE THINGS REMARKABLE,  LESS KNOWN ABOUT, CHENEY, HOW  MUCH OF A SHARED HERITAGE OR  OUTLOOK ON THE AMERICAN  IMAGINATION THEY HAD, WHICH IS  TO SAY BUSH WAS RAISED IN THE  MIDDLE WEST AND CHENEY WAS  RAISED IN WYOMING. THEY BOTH HAD A REALLY HARD TIME WHEN THEY CAME TO THE EAST COAST BOTH GOING TO YALE AND SORT OF  REACTED TO THAT. TELL US A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THAT SHARED HERITAGE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S INTERESTING. WE THINK OF THEM AS DIFFERENT  PERSONALITIES. THEY ARE. BUSH IS VERY OUTGOING, LIKES TO  MAKE PUBLIC JOKES. HE ENJOYS PUBLIC EVENTS. CHENEY IS MORE STOIC, MORE LOW  KEY, CLEARLY NOT AN EXTROVERT IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE. THEY DID GROW UP OUT WEST,  BRISTLE AT THE EASTERN  ESTABLISHMENT ELITISM THEY  FOUND, THEY BELIEVED. I THINK IT SHAPED THEIR OUTLOOSE ON LIFE. THEY ARE FIVE YEARS APART IN  AGE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHICH IS CRAZY. TO THINK CHENEY IS FIVE YEARS  OLDER THAN BUSH, ALMOST  OVERLAPPED, TWO YEARS APART AT  YALE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HE&#39;S STOLEN SO MANY SOULS. HE SEEMS OLDER IS WHY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE WON&#39;T COMMENT ON SOULS,  HAVING OR NOT HAVING, ONE OF THE THINGS YOU TALK ABOUT IS 9/11  REPORTING PETER DOES IN THE  BOOK. JUST THE CHAOS IN AND AROUND  THAT MOMENT. I WILL READ A QUICK EXCERPT. 9/11 BUSH CALLED CHENEY, SOUNDS  LIKE A MINOR WAR. I HEARD ABOUT THE PENTAGON,  WE&#39;RE AT WAR. SOMEBODY IS GOING TO PAY. CHENEY TOLD BUSH TO STAY AWAY  FROM WASHINGTON UNTIL THEY COULD DETERMINE IT WAS SAFE. YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE PLANE THAT WENT DOWN OUTSIDE OF  SHANKSVILLE, PENNSYLVANIA, THE  CHAOS WITH FIGHTER JETS AND NOT  KNOWING IF THEY COULD BRING THE  PLANE DOWN.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I SHOULD LET PETER TELL THE  STORIES FROM THE BOOK. I&#39;VE BEEN READING, EXCELLENT  BOOK. A SCENE, PLANE GOES DOWN IN  PENNSYLVANIA, DICK CHENEY HAS  GIVEN THE ORDER TO SHOOT DOWN  THE PLANE, SCRAMBLE THE JETS. BECAUSE EVERYTHING WAS IN CHAOS, JESS SCRAMBLED WITHOUT MISSILES  IN THEM. THE FIGHTER PILOTS DECIDE THE  WAY THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE DOWN  THE PLANE IS A SUICIDE MISSION,  RAM INTO IT. THE PLANE GOES DOWN, NOBODY  KNOWS HOW IT GOES DOWN BECAUSE  THEY DON&#39;T THINK THE JETS WENT  INTO IT, THEY DON&#39;T THINK JETS  SHOT AT IT BUT CHENEY KNOWS  LINES OF COMMUNICATION ARE SO  BAD HE&#39;S NOT SURE IF HE&#39;S  ACTUALLY SHOT DOWN A PLANE FULL  OF CIVILIANS OR NOT. THEY HAVE AN ADDRESS TO GIVE  THAT NIGHT AND THEY DON&#39;T KNOW  WHAT THEY CAN SAY ABOUT THE  PLANE. THEY DON&#39;T WANT TO GET IT WRONG. IF YOU SAY YOU DID NOT SHOOT  DOWN A PLANE OF CIVILIANS AND  YOU DID THE AMERICAN PEOPLE  AREN&#39;T GOING TO FORGIVE YOU  QUICKLY. IT&#39;S A GREAT MOMENT. THE QUESTION PETER, I THOUGHT  YOU DID REALLY WELL IN THE BOOK, SHOES HOW IT WAS, THINGS CAN GO  VERY, VERY VERY WRONG, DARKNESS  PREDATED, INTERESTED IN THE  CONTINUITY GOVERNMENT EXERCISES  WHAT HAPPENS IF THE GOVERNMENT  IS DECAPITATED BY NUCLEAR  WEAPON. THEN 9/11 HAPPENS, IT&#39;S A  CONFIRMATION THE WORLD IS AS  GLOOMY AS HE THOUGHT. IT UNLEASHES THIS SIZED HIM. PEOPLE DIDN&#39;T KNOW REALLY WAS  THERE. HIS LONG TIME POLITICAL ALLIES  HADN&#39;T KNOWN THIS WAS THE DICK  CHENEY EXISTING.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE REAL DICK CHENEY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE MISSED THAT. A LOT OF PEOPLE MISUNDERSTOOD  THAT THE CHENEY THEY SAW ON  &quot;MEET THE PRESS,&quot; WHO WAS SO LOW KEY AND MODERATE IN DEMEANOR  MASKED THE FACT HE WAS ALWAYS  VERY CONSERVATIVE, ALWAYS VERY  CONCERNED ABOUT THESE ISSUES OF  AN APOCALYPTIC POSSIBILITIES. BUGS AND GAS, CHEMICAL WEAPONS  AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS. WHEN 9/11 HAPPENS, THIS IS KIND  OF A CONFIRMATION. YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER WHAT  HAPPENS IN THE MONTHS AFTER. NOT JUST 9/11 BUT ANTHRAX  ATTACKS AND OTHER THINGS WE  DIDN&#39;T NECESSARILY KNOW AT THE  TIME. BOTULISM SCARE IN THE WHITE  HOUSE, PRESIDENT BUSH AND VICE  PRESIDENT CHENEY TOLD THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN INFECTED BY PATHOGEN. PAKISTANI NUCLEAR SCIENTISTS WHO WERE REPORTED TO HAVE BEEN  TALKING TO OSAMA BIN LADEN. OTHER SCARES. EVERY DAY THEY WERE GETTING WAYS THEY THOUGHT BIG THINGS MIGHT  HAPPEN. THAT SHAPED THE OUTLOOK AND  SHAPED THE RESPONSE TO 9/11 FROM THEN ON. VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY BELIEVED  THAT VERY LITTLE WAS  OUT-OF-BOUNDS IF IT CAME TO  PROTECTING THE COUNTRY AGAINST  WHAT HE THOUGHT, ANYWAY, WAS AN  EXISTENTIAL THREAT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IN SOME WAYS WE&#39;RE NOT  THROUGH THAT PERIOD. PRESIDENT OBAMA MAY NOT HAVE  ARTICULATED OR PRONOUNCED A FEAR OF THE DARKNESS BUT THAT LOOMS  LARGELY OVER THIS COUNTRY AND  OUR COUNTER-TERRORISM POLICIES.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; GRANTED THERE&#39;S A DISTINCT  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BARACK OBAMA  AND DICK CHENEY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WITHOUT QUESTION. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BUT I DO REMEMBER THIS. THE ENIGMA DICK CHENEY  REPRESENTED TO A LOT OF PEOPLE  WHO KNEW HIM SO WELL IN THE  FIRST BUSH ADMINISTRATION, COLIN POWELL TYPES. THEY WERE COMPLETELY DUMBFOUNDED BY THE TURN HE SEEMED TO TAKE. SOUNDS LIKE THERE WAS MUCH MORE  CONTINUITY THERE AND PEOPLE WERE PROJECTING ONTO DICK CHENEY WHEN THEY SAW HIM AS THIS REALIST OR  COMPETENT, MODERATE REPUBLICAN. ONE QUESTION I HAVE FOR PETER. I&#39;D LIKE YOU TO SPELL OUT YOUR  THEORY OF BUSH&#39;S PSYCHE. WHY WAS IT HE BECAME SO  DEPENDENT ON THIS FATHER FIGURE. SEEMS LIKE INSECURITY KIND OF  MARKED A LOT OF THE  RELATIONSHIP.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, THAT&#39;S A VERY GOOD  POINT. LOOK, YOU&#39;RE GETTING IN THERE AS PRESIDENT HAVING ONLY BEEN  GOVERNOR OF TEXAS. I DON&#39;T WANT TO SAY ONLY. THAT GFS YOU VERY LITTLE, NO  NATIONAL SECURITY BACKGROUND. THE LARGEST NATIONAL SECURITY  ATTACK, THREAT TO THE UNITED  STATES HOMELAND SINCE WORLD WAR  II HAPPENS ON YOUR WATCH. YOU&#39;RE GOING TO TURN TO THE GUY  WHO HAS BEEN THERE, WHO SEEMS SO CONFIDENT, SO CALM IN A CRISIS. VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY SAID ON  MSNBC THIS MORNING, SAID ON  9/11, ALL THE CONTINUITY OF  GOVERNMENT EXERCISE KIND OF  KICKED IN ON 9/11 AND BEGAN JUST GOING INTO ALMOST AUTOPILOT OF  THE THINGS HE HAD LEARNED. FOR BUSH, THIS IS ALL NEW. HE DID RELY ON HIM. THE PSYCH EARTHQUAKE, THERE WAS  AN INSECURITY AT SOME POINT. I THINK IT PLAYS OUT OVER TIME. CHENEY SORT OF EMBRACES AT SOME  POINT THE DARK REPUTATION HE  HAS. HE FINDS IT MUSING, ABSURD,  DOESN&#39;T BOTHER HIM THAT MUCH.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; DARTH VADER HELMET AND HAD A  PHOTO TAKEN.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HE PUTS ON THE DARTH VADER  MASK. THERE&#39;S A PICTURE SOMEWHERE IN  THE ARCHIVES, THERE&#39;S A PICTURE  OF DICK CHENEY IN THE DARTH  VADER MASK THAT HAS BEEN  RELEASED. HE WANTED IT IN HIS MEMOIR,  LYNNE CHENEY THOUGHT IT WASN&#39;T A GOOD IDEA AND TALKED HIM OUT OF  IT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; PROBABLY NOT A GOOD IDEA.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BUSH IS SENSITIVE AND REVEALS THAT TO GUESTS AND HISTORIANS  WHO VISIT HEM. HE MAKES CLEAR HE FINDS ANNOYING THIS IDEA THAT HE&#39;S NOT IN  CHARGE OF HIS OWN WHITE HOUSE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AT THE SAME TIME AS MUCH AS  WE TALK ABOUT THE DARKNESS  WITHIN, SALLY, DICK CHENEY CAME  FROM A FAMILY OF NEW DEAL  DEMOCRATS. AT ONE POINT PETER WRITES ABOUT  HIS SUPPORT FOR GOVERNMENT  WORKERS AND SAID CHENEY HAD  RESPECT FOR GOVERNMENT, THE SON  OF A CAREER GOVERNMENT WORKER,  CHENEY WOULD CROSS OUT THE WORD  BUREAUCRAT IN NEWS RELEASES AND  INSERT PUBLIC SERVANT INSTEAD,  WHICH IS FAIRLY DRAMATIC GIVEN  HOW WE&#39;VE WATCHED A STEADY AND  CONCERTED EFFORT UNDERMINING THE ROLE OF SERVICE IN THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AS MUCH AS IT PAINS ME TO SAY THIS, THE DUDE IS NOT ALL BAD. SOME OF THE STUFF HE&#39;S DONE IN  HIS PARTY AND THE COUNTRY AROUND GAY RIGHTS AND SAME-SEX MARRIAGE IS WORTH BEING APPLAUDED. I WAS CERTAIN HE PUT THE CHENEY  MASK ON OVER THE DARTH VADER  HELMET, NOT THE OTHER WAY  AROUND. ONE QUESTION FOR PETER AND THE  BOOK IS ON MY NIGHTSTAND. I LOVE YOUR BOOK IS COMING OUT  JUST AS CHENEY&#39;S BOOK IS COMING  OUT SO YOU CAN HELP US NARRATE  THIS EXPERIENCE. THE FACT THAT CHENEY IS NOW  CRITICIZING SO POINTEDLY  PRESIDENT OBAMA&#39;S FOREIGN  POLICY, AND AS YOU&#39;VE NOTED  MIRRORS PRESIDENT BUSH&#39;S FOREIGN POLICY IN THE SECOND TERM, DO  YOU THINK THIS IS A VEILED WAY  OF CHENEY BEING ABLE TO PUBLICLY CRITIQUE FOREIGN POLICY MOVES  BUSH MADE IN THE SECOND TERM? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I DO. A PROXY ON THE DEBATE HE HAD IN  PRIVATE WITH PRESIDENT BUSH. HE RESPECTS PROTOCOL, THE  OFFICE, PRESIDENT BUSH. HE WOULDN&#39;T SAY PUBLICLY A LOT  OF THE THINGS HE FELT PRIVATELY  AND ARGUED PRIVATELY. PRESIDENT OBAMA BEING A DEMOCRAT GIVES HIM A CONVENIENT WAY TO  EXPRESS THESE FRUSTRATIONS HE&#39;S  HAD WITH THE DIRECTION NATIONAL  SECURITY POLICY HAS GONE THE  LAST FEW YEARS. PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS TAKEN IT  FURTHER THAN PRESIDENT BUSH IN  TERMS OF MODERATING OR MAKING  COMPROMISESES CHENEY FINDS  OBJECTIONABLE. HE&#39;S UNSHACKLED. WHEN BUSH SAW PRESIDENT OBAMA  TAKE OATH OF OFFICE HE SAID,  FREE AT LAST, FREE AT LEAST. BUSH WAS DONE WITH POLITICS. FOR CHENEY HE WAS FREE AT LAST  TO FINALLY EXPRESS SOME OF THE  THOUGHTS HE HAD BEEN HAVING FOR  A NUMBER OF YEARS BUT KEPT QUIET INSIDE THE WEST WING.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; PETER, I WONDER WHAT YOU AND  OTHER FOLKS AT THE TABLE HERE  THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT  CHENEY, WE PLAYED THE SOUND FROM HIM SUNDAY SAYING IT&#39;S  IMPORTANT -- SPEAKING OF THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY, THAT WE BRING  IN A NEW GENERATION OF  LEADERSHIP. HE SAID AT ONE POINT WE GOT  WHIPPED. WHERE DOES CHENEY FIT IN TODAY&#39;S MODERN REPUBLICAN PARTY? DOES THAT MESSAGE HAVE ANY  RESONANCE? WE KNOW KARL ROVE HAS BEEN TO  SOME DEGREE SIDELINED DESPITE  THE FACT HE SOWED THE SEEDS OF  MUCH OF THE CURRENT CROP. I WONDER WHERE YOU THINK DICK  CHENEY FITS IN? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; DICK CHENEY IS REALLY NOT A  TEA PARTY REPUBLICAN, NEITHER IS GEORGE W. BUSH. DICK CHENEY ON FOREIGN POLICY IS EXACT OPPOSITE WHAT TEA PARTY  REPUBLICANS FEEL. THEY HAVE A MUCH MORE  ISOLATIONIST MIGHT BE TOO STRONG BUT CERTAINLY MORE OF A  RESTRAINED VIEW OF AMERICAN ROLE IN THE WORLD AND CHENEY BELIEVES IN A VERY ROBUST NATIONAL  SECURITY OUT THERE. THEY ARE ON SUCH OPPOSITE SIDES. EVEN ON OTHER ISSUES. CHENEY OBVIOUSLY IS AN ECONOMIC  CONSERVATIVE. HE ALSO SAID IN SOME OF THESE  MEETINGS DEFICITS DON&#39;T MATTER. HE WAS STRONG AS DEFICIT HAWK. I THINK THIS IS A NEW KIND OF  TEA PARTY. HE&#39;S TRYING TO ADAPT HIMSELF TO  IT. HE AGREES WITH SOME OF THE  THINGS THEY SAY ABOUT OBAMA CARE AND CURRENT ADMINISTRATION. HIS DAUGHTER IS OBVIOUSLY  RUNNING FOR SENATE IN WYOMING.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; EZRA.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IN TERMS OF THE PARTY CHENEY  WIELDED INSIDE THE BUSH WHITE  HOUSE, ONE WAY THE BOOK IS  PORTRAYED IS GEORGE W. BUSH WAS  IN CHARGE. THE IMPRESSION I&#39;VE TAKEN FROM  IT SO FAR WAS ACTUALLY THAT  CHENEY WAS VERY, VERY GOOD AT  BEING PUBLICLY SUBSERVIENT, SUB  MISSIVE BUT HE WAS AN INCREDIBLY GOOD STAFFER. HE UNDERSTOOD HOW POWER WORKED  IN THE WHITE HOUSE, KEY ROLES. HE PLAYED AN INCREDIBLY CRUCIAL  ROLE STAFFING THE WHITE HOUSE. HE DID AN EFFECTIVE JOB SETTING  UP CHOICE ARCHITECTURE. GEORGE W. BUSH MADE DECISIONS  CHENEY PRESENTED TO HIM. WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT  ARCHITECTURE GOT OUT OF HIS  CONTROL. BEFORE THAT HE WAS POWERFUL. NOT IN THE SENSE HE WAS A PUPPET MASTER BUT HE SET UP DECISIONS  THAT IT ONLY MADE SENSE FOR  GEORGE W. BUSH TO GO IN THE WAY  CHENEY WOULD HAVE WANTED HIM TO  GO. IS THAT AN INCORRECT  INTERPRETATION OF IT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S A FAIR POINT. PRESIDENT BUSH GAVE HIM THIS  ROLE. HE SAID TO VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY YOU SET UP THE TRANSITION, YOU  SET UP THE BEGINNING OF THE  ADMINISTRATION WITH PEOPLE HE  KNOWS AND TRUSTS AROUND VARIOUS  PLACES. HE GIVES THE VICE PRESIDENT HIS  OWN STAFFER THE SAME RANK AS THE PRESIDENT&#39;S STAFFERS. THE VICE PRESIDENT GETS AN EXTRA OFFICE ON CAPITOL HILL NOBODY  HAD ON THE HOUSE SIDE. ALL THESE DIFFERENT TOOLS OF  POWER THAT VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY KNOWS HOW TO WIELD. HE&#39;S ABLE TO GUIDE PRESIDENT  BUSH WHO AT THAT POINT IS  LEANING ON HIM A LOT IN A VERY  EFFECTIVE WAY. HE HAS HAD ONE-ON-ONE MEETING  WITH HIM MEETING WITH HIM EVERY  WEEK. PEOPLE SAID CHENEY WAS NOT THE  BIG VOICE IN MOST OF THESE  MEETINGS. HE WOULD SIT BACK AND BE QUIET,  REALLY WOULDN&#39;T SAY ANYTHING IF  THE PRESIDENT ASKED HIM TO. THEY KNEW WHEN THE PRESIDENT  WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM  SCRATCHING THEIR HEADS TRYING TO FIGURE WHERE HE STOOD ON  SOMETHING HE WAS LEFT BEHIND. IT WAS THE 2011 THEM ALORNE  TOGETHER AT THAT POINT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT THE NEW  GENERATION OF REPUBLICAN  LEADERSHIP ONE CAN&#39;T HELP BUT  THINK OF HIS OWN -- HE&#39;S  PLUGGING HIS OWN DAUGHTER --  SHAMELESSLY PLUGGING HIS OWN  DAUGHTER&#39;S SENATE CAMPAIGN. WHILE DICK CHENEY MAY NOT BE A  TEA PARTY CONSERVATIVE HIMSELF,  DOESN&#39;T LIKE ISOLATIONIST,  ECONOMIC POPULISM, NOT A  LIBERTARIAN, HIS DAUGHTER  TETHERED HERSELF PRETTY FIRMLY  TO THE TEA PARTY. GIVEN EVERYTHING YOU&#39;VE LEARNED  ABOUT DICK CHENEY, WHAT&#39;S YOUR  THEORY OF THIS CAMPAIGN AND THE  WAYS IN WHICH HE KIND OF SEEMS  TO BE GOING ALL IN ON IT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; OF COURSE IT&#39;S HIS DAUGHTER. WHY WOULDN&#39;T HE? THAT&#39;S THE THING. IT IS AN AWKWARD SITUATION IN  WYOMING --  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; DO YOU THINK HE ENCOURAGED  HER TO RUN? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I DON&#39;T KNOW THAT I DON&#39;T  THINK HE DISCOURAGED HER. HE&#39;S PROUD OF HIS DAUGHTER. NO QUESTION IN THAT HOUSEHOLD,  WHAT SOMEBODY TOLD ME DICK  CHENEY HAS THREE PEOPLE HE  REALLY TRUSTS IN THE WORLD AND  ALL THEIR LAST NAMES ARE CHENEY, LYNN, LIZ, MARY CHENEY. THEY ARE A TIGHT-KNIT FAMILY,  SUPPORTIVE OF EACH OTHER AND  SOMETIMES DISTRUSTFUL OF  OUTSIDERS. IT CAUSED A RIFT IN POLITICS,  HIS FRIEND AL SIMPSON, THERE&#39;S  SOME CONSTERNATION. YOU MENTIONED LIZ CHENEY AND TEA PARTY. IT&#39;S AN INTERESTING BALANCE  SHE&#39;S TRYING TO HAVE HERE. SHE&#39;S TRYING TO RIDE THE TEA  PARTY WAVE WITH HER FOCUS ON  DOMESTIC ISSUES BUT SHE HERSELF  IS MORE CONSERVATIVE. HER FATHER NEVER BIG ON  DEMOCRACY ISSUE, THAT&#39;S  SOMETHING LIZ CHENEY FEELS  PASSIONATELY ABOUT. NOT MUCH OF AN ISSUE IN THIS  CAMPAIGN.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; DO BUSH AND CHENEY  COMMUNICATE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THEY HAVE A PROPER  RELATIONSHIP, APPROPRIATE  RELATIONSHIP BUT THEY ARE NOT  BUDDIES. THEY DON&#39;T SPEND A A LOT OF TIME ON THE PHONE TOGETHER. LAST TIME IN APRIL WHEN  PRESIDENT BUSH OPENED HIS  LIBRARY. HE WAS GRACIOUS TO VICE  PRESIDENT CHENEY FROM THE STAGE. IT WAS INTERESTING THAT VICE  PRESIDENT CHENEY DIDN&#39;T HAVE A  SPEAKING ROLE, CONDI RICE DID. IF YOU WENT INSIDE THE LIBRARY  AFTER THE CEREMONY WHAT YOU SAW  WERE A LOT OF PICTURES AND  EXHIBITS, TALKING ABOUT THE  PRESIDENT, OBVIOUSLY, BUT ALSO  LAURA BUSH, JEN AND BRASH RA  BUSH, EVEN STATUES OF THE DOG  AND CAT BUT NOT THAT MUCH OF  DICK CHENEY THERE IN THE  LIBRARY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; FASCINATING. FASCINATING. FASCINATE.

THE LATEST IN THE PROBLEM WITH  THE ROLLOUT OF THE AFFORDABLE  CARE ACT. IT WAS A DISASTER EXCEPT EVERY  MAJOR INSURANCE PROGRAM SEEMS TO HAVE EXPERIENCED SIMILAR  PROBLEMS WHEN FIRST UNVEILED. REWIND NOVEMBER 8th, 2005, THE  DAY THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION  LAUNCHED ITS NEW MEDICARE  PRESCRIPTION BENEFIT FOLLOWING  WEEKS OF DELAY. HERE IS HOW &quot;THE WASHINGTON  POST&quot; SUMMED UP THE LAUNCH. THE ORIGINAL DEBUT DATE WAS  OCTOBER 13th. OFFICIALS DELAYED IT CITING  JEWISH HOLIDAY YOM KIPPUR. NEXT DATE CAME AND WENT WITHOUT  PLANS AVAILABLE. BY THE TIME THE SITE LAUNCHED A  MONTH LATER THE ONLINE TOOL  NEEDED FIXING. VISITORS COULD NOT ACCESS IT FOR MOST OF THE FIRST TWO HOURS. WHEN IT FINALLY CAME UP AROUND  5:00 P.M. IT OPERATED SLOWLY. STILL WITH PROJECTED RESOLUTION  ONLY AT THE END OF NOVEMBER, THE TECH PROBLEMS FACING ACA ARE  SIGNIFICANT. WHETHER THEY WILL HAVE ANY  TANGIBLE EFFECT ON ACTUAL  ENROLLMENT REMAINS TO BE SEEN. AS GENTLE REMINDER EARLY  ENROLLMENT OF A SIMILAR PLAN,  MASSACHUSETTS HEALTH CARE PLAN  KNOWN ALSO AS ROMNEY CARE SHOWS  123 POOL ENROLLED IN THE NEW  LANCE AFTER ONE MONTH. BUT AFTER TWO MONTHS OVER 2200  PEOPLE REPUBLICAN SIGNED UP. ULTIMATELY IT WASN&#39;T UNTIL EARLY ENROLLMENT WAS OVER 11 MONTH  AFTER THE EXCHANGES BECAME  AVAILABLE THE MASSACHUSETTS  RESIDENTS SIGNED UP IN DROVES. 36,167 OF THEM TO BE EXACT. EZRA, I KNOW YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN  FOLLOWING THIS. I THINK WE MAY HAVE BORROWED ONE OF YOUR CHARTS POSSIBLY. THANK YOU FOR THAT THE TECHNICAL STUFF IS AN ISSUE. BEHAVIOR AROUND ENROLLMENT SEEMS NOT TO BE A DISASTROUS THING FOR THE ADMINISTRATION. IT MAY HAPPEN LATER.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE DON&#39;T KNOW YET EXACTLY. I THINK YOU IDENTIFIED THE EXACT RIGHT, TO WHAT DEGREE DOES THE  TACTICAL STUFF BECOME AN  ENROLLMENT PROBLEM. THE SITUATION WITH MEDICARE PART D, THEY DIDN&#39;T LAUNCH THREE  WEEKS. AT THIS POINT THE WEBSITE HAD  JUST LAUNCHED DESPITE IT DUE ON  THAT TERM.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOM KIPPUR OFTEN SLOWS IT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S AN INCREDIBLE EXCUSE. DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS NOW  THINK IT&#39;S A SUCCESS. REPUBLICANS IN PARTICULAR LOVE  IT. JOHN BOEHNER IN HIS FIRST MAJOR  INTERVIEW AS MINORITY LEADER,  FOX NEWS SUNDAY THE ROLE OF  MEDICARE PART D HE HELPED  SHEPHERD THROUGH THE HOUSE,  THAT&#39;S HORRENDOUS. THAT&#39;S HOW FOLKS WHO SHEPHERDED  IT ARE THINKING ABOUT IT. THE PROBLEM WITH OBAMA CARE YOU  NEED TO GET ENOUGH YOUNG HEALTHY PEOPLE IN THE POOLS TO KEEP  PREMIUMS LOW. IF YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE  IT&#39;S DIFFICULT TO SIGNED UP FOR  AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME,  PEOPLE WHO NEED INSURANCE MORE  COMING IN, THEY WILL WAIT, THEY  WILL GET ON THE PHONE, THEY WILL RELOAD THE WEBSITE BUT YOUNG AND HEALTHY PEOPLE MIGHT PAY THE  MANDATE FIRST YEAR. THAT MEANS INSURANCE WILL CHARGE HIGHER PREMIUMS SECOND YEAR,  THEN PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO  HURT. WE ARE NOT YET AT THE POINT  WHERE THAT IS AN INEVITABILITY. IF THEY GET THIS FIXED BY  NOVEMBER, THAT IS PROBABLY  ENOUGH TIME TO GET YOUR  ENROLLMENT RIGHT. IF YOU BEGIN DRAGGING INTO  DECEMBER, MUCH MORE JANUARY,  FEBRUARY, PEOPLE SHOULD BEGIN TO REALLY, REALLY, REALLY BE  AFRAID.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; EZRA, IF YOU CAN&#39;T GET THAT  RIGHT IN THAT SHORT TIMEFRAME,  THEN WHAT? IS THERE AN EMERGENCY SWITCH  THAT SHOULD BE FLIPPED IN ORDER  TO --  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I AM TOTALLY AGAINST THE IDEA YOU DELAY THE INDIVIDUAL  MANDATE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE  GOING TO SIGN UP IN THE END  ANYWAY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; EXTEND OPEN ENROLLMENT THE  AMOUNT OF TIME YOU NEED TO  EXTEND IT. YOU CAN DO A LITTLE DELAY. YOU CAN OPEN ENROLLMENT MANDATE  ONLY HITS IN APRIL. THERE&#39;S THINGS YOU CAN DO. ASSUMING A BAD SCENARIO, THIS  DOESN&#39;T GET FIXED UNTIL  DECEMBER, THAT&#39;S A MONTH AFTER  THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROMISING. EVEN SO THE MANDATE DOESN&#39;T HIT  YOU UNTIL MARCH 31st. THAT&#39;S A SOLID THREE AND A HALF  DEPENDING IN DECEMBER MONDAYS TO SIGN UP. I ACTUALLY THINK THAT MIGHT BE  OKAY. THE PROBLEM IS IF YOU DELAY THE  MANDATE YOU ENSURE IN THE SECOND YEAR PREMIUMS ARE HIGHER, GOING  TO GET THAT MUCH HARDER TO GET  PEOPLE TO SIGN UP. DELAYING THE MANDATE PREVENTS  YOUR ABILITY TO STABILIZE THE  LAW WHEN YOU FIX IT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I&#39;M NOT A REPUBLICAN  STRATEGIST, EVEN THOUGH I  SOMETIMES PLAY ONE ON  TELEVISION. JUST KIDDING. I THINK THE TALKING POINT IS NOT ABOUT THE WEBSITE. IT&#39;S ABOUT THE PREMIUMS. IT&#39;S ABOUT THE FACT PEOPLE ARE  ACTUALLY LOSING THE INSURANCE  PLANS THEY HAVE BECAUSE THEY  DON&#39;T ABIDE BY ACA LAWS. AS THE &quot;L. A. TIMES&quot; REPORTS  MIDDLE IN COME CONSUMERS FACE AN ESTIMATED 30% RATE INCREASE ON  AVERAGE IN CALIFORNIA DUE TO  SEVERAL FACTORS TIED TO THE  HEALTH CARE LAW. THAT, I THINK, IS SOMETHING  REPUBLICANS IF YOU&#39;RE GOING TO  VILIFY THE LAW, PUT YOUR IRON IN THE FIRE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HAWAII PICK 1 IRON IN THE  FIRE. THIS IS ALL SABOTAGE ALL THE  TIME. I LOVE, HEY, THIS THING WE&#39;VE  BEEN TRYING TO DESTROY THREE  YEARS, WE&#39;RE ANGRY PEOPLE CAN&#39;T  GET ACCESS TO IT. IF WE GO BACK TO MEDICARE PART  D, THERE&#39;S ONE PROPOUND  DIFFERENCE, DEMOCRATS DIDN&#39;T  LIKE THE LAW EITHER. WHEN IT CAME TIME TO IMPLEMENT  IT, MAKE IT SUCCESSFUL, DO THE  JOB THEY WERE PUT IN WASHINGTON  TO DO, THEY HELPED. FOLKS MAY NOT I ACTUALLY GOT  OBAMA CARE, I ENROLLED. THINGS ARE LOOKING GOOD. I&#39;VE SAVED OVER $5,000 BUCKS A  YEAR. IT IS A BIG DEAL FOR A LOT OF  PEOPLE. SOME PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SEE  PREMIUMS GO UP. MORE PEOPLE SEE THEIR PREMIUMS  GO DOWN. WHEN WE GET INTO THIS LITTLE  SMALL FIGHT, WE LOSE ALL THE  ROAR REASONS THIS IS HELPING  MOST AMERICANS. THERE&#39;S SO MANY SAVINGS. LETS FOCUS ON THE BIG THINGS  MAKING THE LAW SUCCEED BEFORE WE TRY AND SPECULATE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; FRANK, BEFORE WE GO,  &quot;POLITICO&quot; HAD A PIECE THAT  REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE HAVE 19 LEGISLATIVE DAYS UNTIL THE END  OF THE YEAR AND ARE LITERALLY  TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEIR  PLATFORM IS BECAUSE THE ONLY  THING THEY HAVE IN THEIR  WHEELHOUSE IS REPEAL ACA. THERE&#39;S NOTHING LEFT IN THE  KITTY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; 19 DAYS, 19 OPPORTUNITIES  TO --  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I GUESS SO. DO YOU CALL FOR 19 -- IS THAT  WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO. IS THAT WHERE THE MODERN  REPUBLICAN PARTY IS AT. NO IMMIGRATION, NOTHING TO DO  WITH ENERGY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SORRY FOR THEM.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; 19 MORE REPEALS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; GOOD LUCK IN 2014.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; EXACTLY, GOOD LUCK IN 2014.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHICH ONE SHOULD I GO FOR.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU&#39;VE KNOWN ME SINCE I WAS  FRANKIE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I&#39;M GOING FOR FRANKIE.

THE LATEST DIPLOMATIC FALLOUT  FROM DOCUMENTS PROVIDED BY  EDWARD SNOWDEN BEGAN LAST WEEK  WHEN &quot;THE GUARDIAN&quot; REPORTED NSA MONITORED PERSONAL  COMMUNICATIONS OF 35 WORLD  LEADERS. AMONG THEM GERMAN CHANCELLOR  ANGELA MERKEL WHO FOND PRESIDENT OBAMA TO COMPLAIN.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE PRESIDENT SPOKE WITH  ANGELA MERKEL ASSURED HER THE  UNITED STATES WAS NOT AND WILL  NOT MONITOR HER.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IS NOT AND WILL NOT BUT WHAT  ABOUT HAS BEEN. RECENT REPORTS IN THE GERMAN  PRESS INDICATE U.S. HAD BEEN  MONITORING MERKEL&#39;S CELL PHONE  SINCE 2002, A FULL THREE YEARS  BEFORE SHE BECAME GERMANY&#39;S  LEADER, BUT DID PRESIDENT OBAMA  KNOW. NOT ACCORDING TO WHITE HOUSE  OFFICIALS WHO TOLD &quot;THE WALL  STREET JOURNAL&quot; THE PRESIDENT  WAS UNAWARE OF TARGETING OF  FOREIGN LEADERS UNTIL THIS  SUMMER&#39;S LEAKS BY EDWARD  SNOWDEN. THE WHITE HOUSE RESPONSE  FOLLOWED A REPORT IN GERMANY&#39;S  NEWSPAPER ASSERTING PRESIDENT  OBAMA WAS PERSONALLY BRIEFED ON  THE MERKEL SITUATION THREE YEARS AGO BY SNOW DIRECTOR KEITH  ALEXANDER AND SIGNED OFF ON IT. SO DID THE PRESIDENT KNOW OR DID HE, LIKE MOST EVERYONE ELSE,  LEARN ABOUT THE ALLEGATIONS BY  PICKING UP A PAPER? DURING LAST MONTH&#39;S G-20 IN ST.  PETERSBURG, THE PRESIDENT  BRUSHED ASIDE NSA ALLEGATIONS  LAID OUT IN, QUOTE, NEWSPAPERS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; PART OF THE PROBLEM HERE IS  WE GET THESE THROUGH THE PRESS  AND THEN I&#39;VE GOT TO GO BACK AND FIND OUT WHAT&#39;S GOING ON WITH  RESPECT TO THESE PARTICULAR  ALLEGATIONS. I DON&#39;T SUBSCRIBE TO ALL THESE  NEWSPAPERS. ALTHOUGH I THINK THE NSA DOES,  NOW AT LEAST.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THIS MORNING THE PRESIDENT  AND SEVERAL NEWSPAPERS READERS  WOKE UP TO THE NEWS THAT THE  U.S. HAS BEEN SPYING ON ANOTHER  ALLY, SPAIN AND THAT THE NSA  MONITORED 60 MILLION SPANISH  PHONE CALLS FROM DECEMBER 2012  UNTIL JANUARY OF THIS YEAR. JOINING ME TODAY, &quot;DAILY BEAST&quot;  COLUMNIST AND ACTIVIST SALLY  COHN, &quot;WASHINGTON POST&quot; EZRA  KLEIN AND EDITOR OF THE NEW  REPUBLIC FRANKLIN FORE. AUTHOR OF DAYS OF FIRE, BUSH AND CHENEY IN THE WHITE HOUSE. PETER, I WANT TO GO TO YOU  FIRST. BEFORE WE GET TO THE BUSH CHAIN  BOOK, IT&#39;S INCREDIBLE AND I  CAN&#39;T WAIT TO TALK ABOUT IT. FIRST TO TALK ABOUT THE NEWS OF  THE DAY, WHICH HAS BEEN A  ROLLING MONTHS LONG NEWS CYCLE,  THE SNOWDEN WEEKS. IN YOUR TIME COVERING THE WHITE  HOUSE, WHICH HAS BEEN SEVERAL  YEARS, DO YOU THINK IT&#39;S  POSSIBLE THE PRESIDENT DID NOT  KNOW THE NSA WAS MONITORING  PERSONAL PHONE CALLS OF 35 WORLD LEADERS? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IS IT POSSIBLE, SURE, IT IS  POSSIBLE. THAT&#39;S A DISTURBING FACT IN  ITSELF. THE PRESIDENT IS LEFT IN THIS  AWKWARD POSITION WHERE NEITHER  OF THE TWO MAIN EXPLANATIONS IS  ALL THAT -- YOU KNOW, ALL THAT  APPEALING. EITHER HE DIDN&#39;T KNOW OR HE DID  KNOW. EITHER ONE HE GETS IN TROUBLE. YOU MENTION THE BUSH BOOK, WHICH IS VERY NICE OF YOU TO MENTION,  IT DOES GO BACK TO THE BUSH  ADMINISTRATION. THESE ARE THE SAME ISSUES,  RIGHT, FOR GOING ON FOR MORE  THAN A DECADE. TO HAVE BEGUN IN 2002 HAPPENED  DURING THE RUN UP TO THE WAR IN  IRAQ. IN THAT TIME WE WERE BUGGING  DELEGATIONS AT THE U.N. TRYING  TO GET A RESOLUTION THROUGH  ABOUT THAT. WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS DONE  INHERITED SURVEILLANCE STRUCTURE HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO CHANGE  BUT, IN FACT, HAS KEPT BROADLY  INTACT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YEAH. INDEED IN THE &quot;WALL STREET  JOURNAL&quot; IT SAYS OFFICIALS AT  THE NSA HAS SO MANY  EAVESDROPPING OPERATIONS UNDER  WAY IT WOULDN&#39;T HAVE BEEN  PRACTICAL TO BRIEF HIM ON ALL OF THEM. THESE DECISIONS ARE MADE AT THE  NSA. THE PRESIDENT DOESN&#39;T SIGN OFF  ON THIS STUFF. THAT PROTOCOL IS NOW UNDER  REVIEW, THE OFFICIAL ADDED. YOU BETTER BET THAT PROTOCOL  UNDER REVIEW. IT DOES NOT SEEM LIKE GOOD  SECURITY POLICY TO HAVE THE  PRESIDENT OUT OF THE LOOP ON  SOMETHING LIKE THIS, PETER.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S RIGHT. THE QUESTION IS, IS THE  PRESIDENT MAD ABOUT THIS OR NOT? HOW MUCH IS PLAUSIBLE  DENIALABILITY, OR DOES HE FIND  IT DISTURBING HE DOESN&#39;T KNOW  ABOUT IT? DOES SOMEBODY LOSE A JOB? SOMEBODY CALLED ON THE CARPET. IT HAS BIG EFFECTS, SWEEPING  E-MAILS FROM ABROAD, METADATA,  TO BE REPORTED AS TAPPING INTO  THE PHONE CALLS OF YOUR PEERS ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE, THAT&#39;S  A WHOLE DIFFERENT LEVEL.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; FRANK, PETER BRINGS UP A  REALLY IMPORTANT POINT. IS THE PRESIDENT MAD. THE SUBSEQUENTLY POINT WOULD BE  IS THE COUNTRY MAD S&amp;P THE  WRITER FROM THE ATLANTIC SEEMS  TO BE MADE. EITHER WAY THE PRESIDENT  DESERVES CENSURE. IF HE SIGNED OFF ON SURVEILLANCE THAT WOULD DAMAGE RELATIONS IF  IT WAS DISCOVERED. IF HE DIDN&#39;T KNOW HE PRESIDED  OVER AN NSA THAT WAS  UNACCOUNTABLE. IF I HAD TO BET I&#39;D PUT MY MONEY ON HE DIDN&#39;T KNOW ALL ALONG. IF HE DID, IT WOULD BE TOO  IMPRACTICAL TO TELL HIM.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I TAKE THE PRESIDENT HIS WORD ABOUT THIS, JUST GIVEN THE SCOPE OF HOW MUCH INFORMATION WAS  GETTING VACUUMED UP. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S SOME HIGH-LEVEL  INFORMATION, THOUGH, ISN&#39;T IT? THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN METADATA, TO PETER&#39;S POINT OF THIS IS  TAPPING ANGELA MERKEL&#39;S CELL  PHONE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IF THE PRESIDENT DID NOT KNOW THAT WE WERE VACUUMING UP CALLS  AND INFORMATION FROM OUR CLOSEST ALLIES, THEN THE THING REALLY,  REALLY, HAS SPUN COMPLETELY OUT  OF CONTROL.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; EZRA, THE THIRD POINT THERE,  OKAY, SO MAYBE THE PRESIDENT IS  MAD. MAYBE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IS  MAD. THE JURY IS STILL OUT ON THAT. THE THIRD QUESTION IS ARE THE  LEADERS THEMSELVES ACTUALLY MAD? I THINK IT&#39;S DIFFERENT WITH THE  GERMANS, YOU HAVE BRAZILIANS WHO CANCELED STATE VISIT, MEXICANS  CALLING FOR AMBASSADORIAL  MEETINGS, THE SPANISH ALSO IN  INQUIRING AND THE FRENCH WHO  WERE INDIGNANT AND OUTRAGED.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THEY ARE ALWAYS THE BEST.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I DON&#39;T KNOW IF YOU SAW THE  QUOTE ON THE AP. IT SAID, LOOK, WE ALL DO THIS. WE REALIZE THE U.S. IS DOING IT  MUCH BETTER AND WE ARE JEALOUS. THAT&#39;S WHAT THE AMBASSADOR SAID. PEOPLE ARE MAD. ONE INTERESTING THING ABOUT  THIS, IT GOES NOT BACK TO  SNOWDEN BUT BACK TO THE  WIKILEAKS. ONE OF THE THEORIES BEHIND  WIKILEAKS IS IF IN LARGE  INSTITUTIONS THE SECRECY THEY  REQUIRE TO OPERATE BREAKS DOWN  THEY CAN&#39;T OPERATE. THIS IS SOMETHING THEY NEVER  QUITE UNDERSTOOD ABOUT  WIKILEAKS. THERE&#39;S A REAL THEORY BEHIND  WHAT THEY WERE DOING. IT WASN&#39;T JUST GETTING  INFORMATION OUT THERE. IT WAS BEGINNING TO TAKE DOWN  LARGE BUREAUCRATIC INSTITUTIONS. WHAT THIS IS DOING IS MAKING IT  LESS AND LESS POSSIBLE FOR  DIPLOMATS TO TALK TO EACH OTHER, PEOPLE HAVE BIG BILATERAL AND  MULTI-LATERAL MEETINGS. THAT&#39;S A VERY BIG DEAL. THAT&#39;S A FAR REACHING  CONSEQUENCE. THE FINAL THING I&#39;LL SAY,  THERE&#39;S A BIT OF WHIPLASH IN  THIS NEWS CYCLE. ON THE ONE HAND WE HAVE STORIES  ABOUT NSA TAPPING EVERY PHONE ON THE PLANET AND THE OTHER PART OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION CAN&#39;T  KEEP A WEBSITE UP. YOU ALMOST WANT TO SWIM  RESPONSIBILITIES HERE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SWITCH THE TWO BRAINS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; COULD IT EFFECTIVELY DO THE  SPYING ON ANGELA MERKEL AND  SOMEONE ELSE DO THE WEBSITE. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WOULD  BE IN BETTER SHAPE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS OF  BOTH. HOW ANGRY ARE AMERICANS ABOUT  EITHER ONE. I DON&#39;T WANT TO GO TOO FAR INTO  THE AC STUFF. I THINK THAT IS THE MAN WITH TWO BRAINS. BUT THE IDEA OF COLLECTING  METADATA ON AMERICANS. I THINK THERE IS SOME PEOPLE  ACTIVISTS, SEEKERS, WRITERS,  JOURNALISTS THAT ARE  LEGITIMATELY UPSET ABOUT THIS. I&#39;M NOT ENTIRELY SURE THE  AMERICAN PUBLIC WOULD BEGIN TO  LITIGATE THIS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I WOULDN&#39;T GO TO ACA. I DON&#39;T THINK THAT&#39;S A GOOD  ANALOGY. I DO THINK GOOD ANALOGY TO  DRONES, DEPORTATION, ALL THESE  POLICIES THAT RHETORICALLY,  ESPECIALLY WHEN HE WAS RUNNING  FOR OFFICE FIRST TIME AROUND HE  DISTANCED HIMSELF FROM. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, INCH BY  INCH, MOMENT BY MOMENT, WE  REALIZED HE&#39;S DOUBLED DOWN ON  SOME OF THE POLICIES BUSH AND  CHENEY BEGAN. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AS FOR  THEIR ANGER, I DON&#39;T KNOW WHY  THEY AREN&#39;T MORE OUTRAGED. WE&#39;RE SEEING LEFT AND  LIBERTARIANS COME TOGETHER FOR  THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME TO EXPRESS SOME OUTRAGE. I THINK PEOPLE THINK OH, WE  TRUST THAT OUR GOVERNMENT IS  DOING THE RIGHT THING WITH THIS  INFORMATION AND KEEPING US SAFE  POST 9/11. THERE&#39;S GOING TO BE MORE AND  MORE PRESSURE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO ACTUALLY SAY WHEN HAS TAPPING WORLD LEADERS PHONE CALLS, THIS  WIDE SWEEP OF OUR OWN E-MAIL  ACTUALLY SAY THIS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; PETER, LET ME ASK YOU, IN  TERMS OF THE ADMINISTRATION  SINCE YOU COVER IT SO CLOSELY,  YOU SAID THE PRESIDENT INHERITED A LOT OF THE BUSH CHENEY  POLICIES AND KEPT THEM IN PLACE. DO YOU THINK THAT&#39;S BECAUSE IT&#39;S EASIER TO DO THAT? DO YOU THINK THERE&#39;S BEEN ROBUST DEBATE INSIDE THE  ADMINISTRATION? AMID ALL THESE REVELATIONS HERE  WE ARE LOOKING AT THE WELCOMING  CEREMONY FOR A NEW DIRECTOR. HAS HE A WHOLE NEW TEAM  BASICALLY. KEITH ALEXANDER IS LEAVING, JOHN BRENNON ONLY AT THE CIA SINCE  MARCH. OF COURSE NEW HEAD OF DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY JEH  JOHNSON. DO YOU THINK WITH THIS NEW BLOOD THERE WILL COME A RETHINKING OF  THE PRESIDENT&#39;S OR THE COUNTRY&#39;S INTELLIGENCE AND  COUNTER-TERRORISM STRATEGY? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THOSE ARE ALL GOOD QUESTIONS  AND ALL GOOD POINTS. PART OF WHAT HAPPENED IS  PRESIDENT OBAMA IN 2008 RAN  AGAINST BUSH&#39;S FIRST TERM BUT  INHERITED BUSH&#39;S SECOND TERM. WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS BY THE  TIME HE LEFT OFFICE HE HAD STAFD OFF THE HARSHEST EDGES OF THE  MOST CONTROVERSIAL POLICIES HE  PUT IN PLACE IN ORDER TO HAVE  THEM LAST BEYOND HIS  ADMINISTRATION. NOBODY HAD BEEN WATERBOARDED  SINCE 2003, GONE ON  SURVEILLANCE, MILITARY  TRIBUNALSES CLOSED CIA BLACK  SITE PRISONS AND SO ON SO THE  NEXT PRESIDENT IN THIS CASE,  BARACK OBAMA, WOULDN&#39;T HAVE TO  NECESSARILY MAKE A RADICAL 180  DEGREE TURN. WHEN OBAMA TOOK OVER, YOU WALK  IN THE OFFICE, THINGS ALREADY  MODERATED, COMPROMISED. YOU SIT THERE EVERY DAY AND GET  SOMEBODY WALKING IN, AN  INTELLIGENCE PERSON TELLING YOU  HERE ARE THE WAYS PEOPLE ARE  TRYING TO KILL YOU OR AMERICANS  TODAY. DO YOU REALLY WANT TO CHANGE  THESE POLICIES SO DRASTICALLY  GIVEN THAT POSSIBLE THREAT OUT  THERE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S SORT OF IT. FRANK, WE&#39;VE TALKED ABOUT THIS. NATIONAL SECURITY HAS REALLY  BECOME THE THIRD RAIL OF  AMERICAN POLITICS. YOU CAN TALK ABOUT SOCIAL  SECURITY, MEDICARE, MEDICAID TO  SOME DEGREE WITHOUT THE BLOW  BACK BUT TALK ABOUT CUTTING BACK FUNDS FOR TERRORISM OR  EXTRAORDINARY WEB OF  SURVEILLANCE WE HAVE, IT IS  ALMOST ANATHEMA IN THE POLITICAL DISCOURSE TO DO THAT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM,  WHAT EZRA DESCRIBED, HE FACED -- HE HASN&#39;T JUST FACED THIS STATE. HE&#39;S FACED THIS COMPLETE EXPOSE  OF THE STATE AT THE SAME TIME. IT&#39;S PUT HIM IN A POLITICALLY  IMPOSSIBLE POSITION. YOU LOOK WHAT HE&#39;S DONE PUSHING  FOR DEFENSE CUTS. YOU WOULD SAY ANATHEMA FOR  DEMOCRAT --  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; OR FOR REPUBLICANS TO SUPPORT SOME OF THOSE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S COME WITH NO POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES. WHAT&#39;S DIFFICULT FOR OBAMA, HE  AGREES WITH A VERY LARGE  PERCENTAGE OF THESE POLICIES  WHICH HE WANTS TO LEGITIMATE AND CONTINUE AN ENSHRINE. I THINK IT&#39;S HARD FOR HIM TO  PUBLICLY MAKE THE CASE FOR  LEGISLATION THAT WOULD CURB SOME OF THESE EXCESSES.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; EZRA.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK IT&#39;S INTERESTING IN  UNDERLYING POLITICS. ONE, WE&#39;RE HAVING HUGE DEFENSE  CUTS RIGHT NOW. ONE OF THE GREAT POLITICAL  MISJUDGMENTS IN THE LAST FEW  YEARS WAS BELIEVING IT&#39;S THE OLD PARTY WITH DEFENSE SPENDING. THE RAND PAUL WING IN POWER  QUICKER THAN THEY REALIZED. IT&#39;S MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE AMONG REPUBLICANS WITH DEFENSE CUTS. NOT TOTAL. YOU ARE SEEING A RIPPING THROUGH OF THAT BUDGET. ONE OF THE THINGS UNSETTLED IN  ADDITION TO WHAT FRANK SAID  ABOUT EXPOSES AND TECHNOLOGICAL  CHALLENGES. TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGES. ON THE ONE HAND YOU&#39;RE HAVING  RAPID EVOLUTION IN THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY ABOUT WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT NATIONAL SECURITY  CONSENSUS THEY HAD HAD FOUR OR  FIVE, SIX YEARS AGO. DEMOCRATIC PART DEMONSTRATING ON ITS OWN, FOLKS ON THE LEFT  UNCOMFORTABLE WITH WHAT BARACK  OBAMA IS DOING. YOU LOOK WHAT DEMOCRATS ARE  SAYING IN POLLS, THEY ARE MUCH  MORE COMFORTABLE WHAT PRESIDENT  OBAMA IS DOING, HIGH APPROVAL  RATING NSA SPYING, NOT AS  CONCERNED ABOUT DRONES. THE POLITICS OF NATIONAL  SECURITY ARE VERY UNSETTLED IN A WAY THAT&#39;S NOT BEEN TRUE FOR A  NUMBER OF YEARS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SALLY ON THAT LAST POINT,  BEFORE WE GO. HOW VOCAL IS THE PROGRESSIVE  LEFT GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE ON  THESE ISSUES? WRAPPED TOGETHER BETWEEN THE  U.N. REPORT ON DRONES, THIS  LATEST SPYING REVELATION THERE&#39;S A LOT OF GRIST FOR THE MILL. IT&#39;S UNCLEAR HOW MUCH THE FAR  LEFT OR PROGRESSIVE LEFT OR  WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT IS  GOING TO GO AFTER A DEMOCRATIC  PRESIDENT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LOOK, ACTUALLY, THIS IS ONE  OF THE MORE INTERESTING THINGS  THAT&#39;S HAPPENED IN THE SECOND  TERM OF THE PRESIDENT, WHICH IS  IN THE FIRST SORT OF TWO TO  THREE YEARS, FIRST TERM, LEFT IN GENERAL WAS FAIRLY HESITANT TO  GO AFTER HIM IN WAYS I AND  CERTAINLY OTHERS FOUND  PROBLEMATIC. THERE&#39;S SORT OF WE TRUST THIS  GUY, WE THINK HE&#39;S GOING TO DO A GOOD JOB ON ISSUES WE CARE  ABOUT. THAT BELIEF AND FAITH HAS BEEN  SLOWLY CHIPPED AWAY AT TO THE  POINT WHERE NOW AGAIN FROM ISSUE TO ISSUE, IMMIGRATION, HEALTH  CARE REFORM AND CERTAINLY ON  FOREIGN POLICY YOU&#39;RE SEEING A  ROBUST LEFT PRESENCE. I WANT TO GO BACK. I THINK THE MORE INTERESTING  THING HERE IS THE NEW COALITIONS FORMING. WHEN YOU SEE CODE PINK AND  FREEDOM WORK JOINING TOGETHER  FOR A RALLY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT MEANS THE WORLD IS OVER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT MEANS AMERICA HAS TO IS  THE UP AND TAKE NOTICE WE&#39;RE  DOING SOMETHING REALLY  TROUBLING. HOPEFULLY THE PRESIDENT WILL  SHOW LEADERSHIP AND TAKE  ACCOUNTABILITY FOR IT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IN A WEIRD WAY NOT EVERYTHING HAS TO BE PARTISAN.","media$content":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":800000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":859.426,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":360,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/vpcIZmhdQtW4?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":640,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":500000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":859.426,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":240,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/LMVC6hY9FBg8?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":420,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":859.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":0,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/HkoWRE7JWhR_?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":0,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"media$thumbnails":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"image","plfile$duration":0.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"JPEG","plfile$height":1080,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_wag_1spy_131028.jpg","plfile$width":1920,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"image","plfile$duration":0.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"JPEG","plfile$height":3840,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Sections/TVNews/MSNBC%20TV/PHOTOS%20-%20AMY/Wagner/_L2A4843.JPG","plfile$width":5760,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"link":"","pubDate":1382981340000,"plmedia$defaultThumbnailUrl":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_wag_1spy_131028.jpg","nnd$associatedPlaylist":{"href":"http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_49748447"},"nnd$brand":"MSNBC","nnd$bureau":"30RockNY","nnd$bviAssetId":"n_wag_1spy_131028","nnd$canonicalUrl":{"href":"http://www.msnbc.com/now-with-alex-wagner/watch/us-in-hot-water-over-spying-allegations-57707587720"},"nnd$distributionProfile":["MSN-CA"],"nnd$firstAiredAtUtc":1382975857000,"nnd$lastAiredAtUtc":1382975857000,"nnd$lastEditorialChangeAtUtc":1383068448000,"nnd$longTitle":"US in hot water over spying allegations","nnd$playCount30":3823,"nnd$playCountDay":13,"nnd$playCountYear":3812,"nnd$requiresCaptioning":true,"nnd$shortDescription":"Sally Kohn, Ezra Klein, Franklin Foer and Peter Baker discuss the reports of the NSA spying on U.S. allies and if the President knew about the surveillance.","nnd$source":"NOW","nnd$sourceId":"nnd_45258737","nnd$sourceUrlSlug":"now-with-alex-wagner","nnd$titleUrlSlug":"us-in-hot-water-over-spying-allegations","nnd$videoType":"Broadcast","nnd$workbenchId":"53396345"},{"$xmlns":{"nnd":"http://partners.nbcnews.com/nnd_mrss"},"guid":"n_wag_d_131025","title":"The shutdown's impact on the Virginia race","author":"","description":"Va. gubernatorial candidates Terry McAuliffe and Ken Cuccinelli held their third and final debate on Thursday ahead of the November 5 election, and it looks like McAuliffe will emerge victorious.

SPEAKING AT VIRGINIA TECH WHERE 32 PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN A MASS SHOOTING JUST SIX YEARS AGO THE CANDIDATES EACH OFFERED RADICALLY DIFFERENT VISIONS FOR COMBATING GUN VIOLENCE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I&#39;M A STRONG SUPPORTER OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT, I&#39;M A GUN OWNER AND HUNTER. BUT I SUPPORT UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I&#39;M AN A RATED NRA CANDIDATE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S BASICALLY IT. HE&#39;S AN A RATED NRA CANDIDATE. IT&#39;S INCREDIBLE WHAT&#39;S GOING ON, SAM, IN VIRGINIA. YOU NOW HAVE LOOKING AT THE POLLS TERRY McAULIFFE, NO EXTREMELY POPULAR FELLOW CRUSHING KEN CUCCINELLI IN THE POST, 46-38, WOMEN VOTERS UP 52-32, JUST LAPPING CUCCINELLI, THEN CUCCINELLI&#39;S ANTI-WOMAN POLICIES AT THE HEART OF IT. OPPOSED TO ABORTION, BIRTH CONTROL MANDATE, STERILIZATION MANDATE. THIS COULD NOT BE A WORSE CANDIDATE EXCEPT FOR THE OTHER TWO PEOPLE ON THE TICKET. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YES. I LIVE IN D.C. AND I GET THE ADVERTISEMENT FOR NORTHERN VIRGINIANS. IT IS ALMOST ALL CONTRACEPTION RELATED. IT IS LITERALLY TARGETING EVERY SINGLE VOTER IN NORTHERN VIRGINIA. THAT SAID, I WILL SAY I THINK KEN CUCCINELLI WILL PROBABLY BE THE FIRST CANDIDATE AFFECTED BY THE SHUTDOWN AND WILL LOSE BECAUSE OF THE SHUTDOWN AND SEQUESTRATION, TOO. THE SHUTDOWN REALLY HURT HIM. THERE&#39;S SO MANY GOVERNMENT JOBS BASED IN VIRGINIA DEPENDING ON THE GOVERNMENT TO STAY OPEN WHERE PEOPLE LITERALLY GOT THEIR LIVES DISRUPTED AND WERE HURT FINANCIALLY. THEY SAW THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AS THE MAIN PROBLEM THERE. I THINK KEN CUCCINELLI. HE WASN&#39;T DOING WELL BEFORE THE SHUTDOWN BUT THAT ZAPPED ANY POSSIBILITY OF COMING BACK. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; A LOT OF FEDERAL EMPLOYEES, GOING BACK TO WOMEN&#39;S ISSUES, I DON&#39;T THINK WE CAN SKIP OVER, WE TALKED ABOUT ON THE BREAK, EMBLEMATIC ON THE REPUBLICAN PARTY RUNNING STRONG ON POLICIES THAT ALARM AND TERRIFY YOUNGER WOMEN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BEYOND THAT, IT ALSO OFFENDS THEM. THE LANGUAGE OF SOME OF THIS LEGISLATION MAKES IT SOUND LIKE YOU DON&#39;T THINK THESE WOMEN HAVE ANY SELF-CONTROL TO DO ANYTHING. THAT&#39;S WHAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY MISUNDERSTOOD LAST TIME WHEN WE WENT THROUGH THIS 2012 CYCLE THAT WOMEN WERE JUST OFFENDED BY HOW THEY WERE BEING TALKED ABOUT. I WILL JUST SAY AS A PERSON WHO HAS DONE CAMPAIGNS, IT MAKES ME A LITTLE NERVOUS. GREAT TERRY IS UP HIGH, HE&#39;S GOING TO HAVE TO TURN OUT OBAMA COALITION, HIGH TURNOUT. IT&#39;S AN ELECTION. YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT&#39;S GOING TO HAPPEN. ALSO IF PEOPLE THINK, WELL, HE&#39;S 40 POINTS AHEAD, I DON&#39;T NEED TO VOTE. THAT WILL HURT HIM. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; COUPLE OF POINTS. FIRST, IT WILL BE CLOSER THAN WHAT THE POLLS ARE SHOWING. KEN KUCUCCINELLI AND BOB McDONNELL WON BY A LANDSLIDE. WOMEN LOOK AT HIM AND SAY I DON&#39;T TRUST HIM BUT THEY TRUST BOB McDONNELL. I DON&#39;T GET THAT. KEN CUCCINELLI IS RUNNING A TERRIBLE RACE. McAULIFFE DOESN&#39;T HAVE TO RUN A GOOD RACE BUT HE HAS TO GET -- &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; McDONNELL DIDN&#39;T HAVE HUGH JACKSON. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt;&gt; BROOKLYN RESIDENTS KAYLA PHILLIPS SWARMED BY FOUR UNDERCOVER NYPD POLICE OFFICERS AFTER LITERALLY PURCHASING A PURSE FROM AN UPSCALE CLOTHING STAR. SHE HAD RECEIVED HER TAX RETURN AND DECIDED TO SPLURGE ON THE BAG. TRAYON CHRISTIAN HANDCUFFED AND DETAINED TWO HOURS AFTER HE BOUGHT A FERRAGAMO BELT. HE SAVED UP FROM A WORK STUDY PROGRAM. NOW BOTH FILING AGAINST NYPD AND BARNEY&#39;S TO FIGHT ALLEGED DISCRIMINATION. ACCORDING TO HIS ATTORNEY, HE SAID HIS ONLY CRIME WAS BEING A YOUNG BLACK MAN. ALEX, YOU HAVE THIS STRANGE THING HAPPENING. STORES MAKE A LOT OF CACHE ON ASSOCIATES LIKE JAY Z AND HIP-HOP FIGURES ACTUALLY ARRESTING PEOPLE FOR COMING IN AND SPENDING MONEY AFTER THEY HAVE SPENT IT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THIS IS 2013, NEW YORK CITY. IT&#39;S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER. IT SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING. BRINGS ME BACK WHEN OBAMA CAME OUT AFTER TRAYVON AND SPOKE ABOUT HOW HE HAD BEEN IN A DEPARTMENT STORE AND HE HAD BEEN TRAILED. ALL THESE CONSERVATIVES SAYING THAT DIDN&#39;T HAPPEN. IT&#39;S JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE. THIS IS ONE OF MANY. THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE. THIS IS GOING ON. WE STILL NEED TO TALK ABOUT ISSUES, WE&#39;RE NOT OVER RACE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE FACT HIS NAME IS TRAYON, TOO SIMILAR FOR WORDS. EXTREMELY UGLY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt;&gt; ANOTHER PIECE, APPARENTLY EDWARD SNOWDEN IS NOT THE ONLY ONE LEAKING INFORMATION, FORMER MOVON DIRECTOR RIDING THE TRAIN YESTERDAY. GREAT STORY. HE OVERHEARD FORMER NSA CIA DIRECTOR MICHAEL PEYTON BRAGGING ABOUT HIS SPY TACTICS. FORMER NSA SPY BOSS MICHAEL HAYDEN ON ACELL, A BEHIND ME BLABBING ON BACKGROUND AS A FORMER SENIOR ADMIN OFFICIALS, SOUNDS DEFENSIVE. HUSSEIN WAS BRAGGING ABOUT RENDITION. SNOWDEN IN RUSSIA, HE SNAGGED A PIC WITH THE SPY BOSS. WERE YOU ON THE TRAIN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I WAS IN THE QUIET CAR. I NEEDED PEACE AND QUIET. I&#39;M KILLING MYSELF I WAS NOT SITTING IN THE NEXT TO LAST CAR. I E-MAILED HIM, WHERE ARE YOU, NEXT TO THE LAST CAR. ACTUALLY, STAY RIGHT HERE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; EVERY STAFFER&#39;S NIGHTMARE. I CAN TELL YOU, WHEN I WORKED WITH HOWARD DEAN WE WOULD HAVE THE CONVERSATION WHEN YOU&#39;RE ON THE TRAIN AND DOING THESE CALLS, IT&#39;S NOT REALLY CALL TIME. EVERYBODY CAN HEAR YOU. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HOW CRAZY DO YOU HAVE TO BE TO BE ADMINISTRATION AND UNDERSTAND THE ONLY PEOPLE ON THE ACELLA ARE JOURNALISTS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE WERE BOTH ON THE ACELA A FEW WEEKS AGO EACH WITH A VIEW OF CHRIS CHRISTIE. I WAS DESPERATELY TRYING TO -- HE WAS GOOD. HE KNEW NOT TO SAY ANYTHING RIDICULOUS. MY ADVICE TO ANY POLITICIAN. ACTUALLY I WENT THEM TO SPEAK.

IT&#39;S INCONSISTENT WITH OUR HISTORY. WE&#39;VE ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT EXPANDING THE FRANCHISE, NOT CONSTRICTING IT. THESE ATTEMPTS THAT ARE TO DO AT BEST PARTISAN AND AT WORST MAYBE EVEN RACIALLY MOTIVATED -- &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THIS WAS ATTORNEY GENERAL HOLDER CRITICIZING CERTAIN VOTER ID LAWS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. ONE OF THE MOST NOT OR REDUCE STATES FOR RESTRICTIONS, TEXAS, ROLLED OUT NEW VOTER ID LAW THIS WEEK. IT WAS EMBARRASSING. INTENDED TO RULE OUT PESKY VOTER FRAUD EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS ONLY FOUR CASES OF VOTER FRAUD LAST YEAR. THAT&#39;S FOUR. THIS WEEK WE GOT A GLIMPSE OF WHAT KIND OF DESPICABLE VOTER ID CRIME THAT WOULD RULE OUT. MEET SONDRA WATTS, A TEXAS STATE JUDGE, A WOMAN WHO HAS VOTED LAWFULLY IN THE STATE OF TEXAS FOR THE PAST FIVE DECADES. JUDGE WATTS WAS FLAGGED FROM VOTER FRAUD AND ALMOST BARRED FROM THE POLLS BECAUSE ON THE DRIVER&#39;S LICENSE JUDGE WATTS MAIDEN NAME IS HER MIDDLE NAME. ON HER VOTER REGISTRATION IT&#39;S HER ACTUAL MIDDLE NAME. WHAT HAPPENED TO SANDRA WATTS ISN&#39;T LIKELY TO BE A ONE OFF OCCURRENCE CONSIDERING 34% OF WOMEN DON&#39;T HAVE DOCUMENTS PROVING THEIR CITIZENSHIP AND BEARING THEIR CURRENT NAME. TEXAS ID VOTER ROLLOUT WAS HARDLY THE VOTER ID STORY OF THE WEEK. THAT HONOR GOES TO THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA, THE STATE WITH THE STRICTEST IN THE NATION AND WHOSE REPUBLICAN PRECINCT LEADER WAS FORCED TO RESIGN THIS WEEK AFTER THIS HAPPENED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NORTH CAROLINA PRECINCT CHAIRMAN AND GOP MEMBER DON YELTSININ THINKS HIS STATE&#39;S NEW VOTING RESTRICTIONS ARE JUST FINE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE LAW IS NOT RACIST. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; OF COURSE THE LAW IS NOT RACIST AND YOU&#39;RE NOT RACIST. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, I&#39;VE BEEN CALLED A BIGOT BEFORE. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, YOU DON&#39;T LOOK LIKE ME BUT I THINK I&#39;VE TREATED YOU LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. AS A MATTER OF FACT, ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS IS BLACK. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ONE OF YOUR BEST FRIENDS WAS BLACK. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YES. I HAD A PICTURE ONE TIME OF OBAMA SITTING ON A STUMP AS A WITCH DOCTOR. I POSTED THAT ON FACEBOOK. FOR INFORMATION I WAS MAKING FUN OF THE WHITE HALF OF OBAMA, NOT THE BLACK HALF. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WE CAN HEAR YOU, RIGHT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YEAH. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WE CAN HEAR YOU. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; JOINING US CONTRIBUTING WRITER FOR THE NATION ARI BERMAN, THE STRUGGLE FOR VOTING RIGHTS FROM 1955 TO TODAY. ARI, WE CAN HEAR YOU. WE CAN HEAR EVERYTHING YOU&#39;RE SAYING. THAT CLIP IS INSANE. WE&#39;RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW CRAZY THAT WAS. FIRST, I WANT YOU TO GIVE US A SUBSTANCE. WHAT IS THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DOING VIS-A-VIS PARTICULARLY TEXAS AND NORTH CAROLINA, VOTING LAWS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THEY HAVE SUED TEXAS AND NORTH CAROLINA UNDER SECTION 2 SAYING BOTH LAWS ARE DISCRIMINATORY. THE REAL PROBLEM IN NORTH CAROLINA IS NOT THE COMMENTS, THE PROBLEM IS THE LAW ITSELF. THE COMMENTS WERE INSANE BUT DISCRIMINATORY LAW IS STILL ON THE BOOKS. NORTH CAROLINA IS JUST ARGUING RIGHT NOW THE LAWSUIT AGAINST IT SHOULD BE DISMISSED. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE SUBSTANCE HERE. YES, THERE ARE REPUBLICAN OFFICIALS SAYING CRAZY, RACIST THINGS, ADMITTING THE LAW IS ABOUT KICKING DEMOCRATS IN THE BUTT BUT THE BIGGER ISSUE IS THAT SO MANY PEOPLE IN NORTH CAROLINA DON&#39;T HAVE IDs EARLY VOTING, SAME DAY REGISTRATION, ALLOWING VIGILANTE POLL WATCHERS, PUBLIC FUNDING, JUDICIAL ELECTIONS, ALL THESE BAD PROVISIONS IN THE BILL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LETS PUT UP A LITTLE OF THAT, SUNDAY VOTING, NO MORE STRAIGHT TICKET IN NORTH CAROLINA, REQUIRES VOTERS TO SHOW GOVERNMENT ISSUED VOTER ID. AS YOU SAID ELIMINATING SAME DAY VOTER REGISTRATION. IT&#39;S INTERESTING HOW BLATANT THE LAWS ARE TARGETING EXACTLY WHAT KIND OF VOTERS. NOW A REPUBLICAN OFFICIAL SAYING, YUP, I&#39;VE BEEN CALLED A BIGOT. IT&#39;S ALL CRAZY. IT&#39;S THE SUBSTANCE THAT&#39;S THE PROBLEM. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THEY ARE NOT HIDING THE BALL. OBVIOUSLY THIS HAPPENED. DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES ARE PUTTING STATES LIKE NORTH CAROLINA AND TEXAS CONSIDERED A DEMOCRATIC TARGET DOWN THE ROAD. IT&#39;S ONE OF THESE THINGS WE&#39;RE TALKING ABOUT, SORT OF A LAST GRASP TO HOLD ONTO THAT SOUTHERN STRATEGY IN A WAY. ARI KNOWS BETTER THAN I. THERE&#39;S DEEP CONCERN IN LEGAL COMMUNITIES THE CHANNELS ERIC HOLDER HAS TO FEND THESE OFF ARE DRAMATICALLY LIMITED. HOW LONG WILL THESE LEGAL CHALLENGES TAKE TO MAY OUT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE TEXAS LAW BLOCKED UNDER SECTION 5 OF THE VOTING RIGHTS. THIS LAW SHOULDN&#39;T BE IN EFFECT NOW. THE ROBERTS COURT OVERRULED THAT DECISION. NOW GOES INTO EFFECT. LOTS OF PEOPLE DISENFRANCHISED. LITIGATION COULD TAKE UP TO A YEAR. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IS THERE CONCERN IT COULD DRAG ON PAST 2014 ELECTIONS? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. CONCERN IN BOTH NORTH CAROLINA AND TEXAS THIS COULD DRAG ON. THEY BASICALLY HAVE TO HOPE FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION. THE PROOF ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, NOT THE STATES DISCRIMINATING TO PROVE DISCRIMINATION. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; QUICKLY, COULD YOU ALSO SEE BECAUSE OF STRIPPING THE BARK OFF OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT THINGS LIKE PURGES YOU&#39;RE SEEING IN FLORIDA AND VIRGINIA. IN THE CASE OF VIRGINIA WE&#39;RE TALKING ABOUT AN ELECTION THIS MONTH. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; REMEMBER ALL THESE STATES THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH HAD TO CLEAR WITH FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THEY HAD TO PROVE THEY WERE NOT DISCRIMINATORY BEFORE THEY WENT INTO EFFECT. NOW THEY DON&#39;T HAVE TO DO THAT ANYMORE. THESE CHANGES GO INTO EFFECT AND JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS TO OBJECT OR VOTING RIGHTS OBJECT. THAT&#39;S A HUGE SHIFT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; TO THE POINT IT&#39;S OBVIOUS WHO THEY ARE TARGETING, THE WOMAN GETS ON THE BALLOT IN TEXAS, ALL OF A SUDDEN WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE RULES. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH WOMEN DECIDED 22 OF 23 SENATE RACES IN 2012. IF YOU DON&#39;T HAVE ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS, IT&#39;S A $20 FEE GENERALLY. WOMEN ARE GOING TO PAY ATTENTION. WE&#39;VE GOT TO PAY FOR MY BIRTH CONTROL, NOW MAKING ME PAY TO VOTE. WOMEN ARE GOING TO GET ENRAGED ABOUT THIS. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH WOMEN IN RED STATES HAVE HIGHER RATES OF DIVORCED. IF YOU&#39;RE DIVORCED YOU&#39;RE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE THE DOCUMENT -- UMM HAVE TO HAVE YOUR DIVORCE PAPERS AS WELL AS YOUR ID TO VOTE. SHOT THEMSELVES IN THE FOOT WITH THIS ONE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU CAN ALSO VOTE WITH A GUN PERMIT AS OPPOSED TO AN ID WITH YOUR LEGAL NAME ON IT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU CAN&#39;T GET A GUN PERMIT IF YOU BEAT YOUR WIFE. THAT GOES TO THE POINT OF WOMEN DIVORCING THEIR HUSBANDS. THE ONLY WAY TO FIX THE PROBLEM, CONGRESS HAS TO FIX IT. CONGRESS HAS TO GO IN AND PASS ANOTHER VOTING RIGHTS ACT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT MEANS IT&#39;S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THEY CAN&#39;T GET AN IMMIGRATION BILL. SENATE PASSED. JUDICIARY COMMITTEE NOT A LIBERAL REPUBLICAN BY ANY MEANS HAS SAID, LISTEN, WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. GREAT, IS IT GOING TO GET US 40 WACKO BIRDS FROM THE CAUCUS TO GET A BILL OFF THE FLOOR, PULL IT THROUGH COMMITTEE, IS THE CHAIRMAN FROM VIRGINIA CHAIRMAN OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE GOING TO MOVE VOTING RIGHTS ACT? ABSOLUTELY NOT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THEY HAVE NO SELF-INTEREST. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; REPUBLICAN PARTY NOT JUST IN THE SOUTH, SPREAD NORTH AND WEST. THAT&#39;S WHY WE&#39;RE SEEING VOTING RESTRICTIONS OUT OF PENNSYLVANIA AND OHIO WHO WEREN&#39;T IN ON THE GAME PREVIOUSLY. CONGRESS DOES HAVE RESPONSIBILITY. THEY PASSED VOTING RIGHTS ACT IN 1965. THEY HAVE REAUTHORIZED IT FOUR TIMES. THE MORE WE HEAR ABOUT WHAT&#39;S HAPPENING IN NORTH CAROLINA, THE MORE WE HEAR WHAT&#39;S HAPPENING IN TECH, JUDGES GETTING ENSNARED BY LAWS, I THINK IT WILL PUT PRESSURE ON CONGRESS. CONGRESS THAT JUST SHUT DOWN PRESIDENT ISN&#39;T GOING TO PASS VOTING RIGHTS. IT&#39;S INEVITABLE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SUPREME COURT CALLED ON CONGRESS TO PASS ANOTHER VERSION OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT WAS PUNTING FIG LEAF PUT OVER A HORRIBLE 50 YEAR ANNIVERSARY ON WASHINGTON, SNATCHING AWAY VOTE RIGHTS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CALLING ON CONGRESS TO DO THINGS IN THEIR MOST BASIC INTEREST. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IN 2017 WHEN RAND PAUL IS PRESIDENT DEMOCRATS WILL ATTACH THIS TO THE DEBT LIMIT DEAL AND DEMAND IT. THAT&#39;S HOW IT&#39;S GOING TO HAPPEN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; PROBLEM SOLVED. APPRECIATE IT. THE NATION&#39;S ARI BERMAN, THANK YOU. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt;&gt; WE&#39;RE JUST GETTING NEW INFORMATION ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. JEFF ZIENTS, THE MAN BROUGHT IN TO FIX HEALTHCARE.GOV HE TOLD REPORTERS IN A CONFERENCE CALL HE EXPECTS IT TO RUN SMOOTHLY BY THE END OF NOVEMBER.

CRUZ&#39;S VICTORY LAP HAS MANY WONDERING HOW DID WE GET HERE. BACK IN 2004 CORPORATE LOBBYIST AND FORMER REPUBLICAN HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER DICK ARMEY FOUND A RIGHT RING GROUP CALLED FREEDOM WORKS, THEY SOUGHT TO REPLICATE GRASSROOTS SUCCESSES OF GROUPS LIKE MOVON AND BRING AS MANY RIGHT WING REPUBLICANS TO CONGRESS AS POSSIBLE. THAT SAME YEAR OIL BILLIONAIRES KACH FOUND ADD SIMILAR GROUP, AMERICANS FOR PROSPERITY WITH THE GOAL OF ROLLING BACK REGULATIONS ON THINGS LIKE ENERGY COMPANIES AS WELL AS TAX RATES ON THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS WHILE CUTTING BENEFITS FOR THE NATION&#39;S POOR. IN NOVEMBER 2010, ESTABLISHMENTS ASTROTURF INVESTMENTS HAD DIVIDENDS. RECORD SPENDING, STOKED FEAR OF HEALTH CARE REFORM, TO WHIP CONSERVATIVE VOTERS INTO AN ANTI-OBAMA POLITICAL FRENZY, REMEMBER THE DEATH PANELS, REPUBLICANS TOOK CONTROL OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. NOW NEARLY 10 YEARS AFTER THIS ODYSSEY BEGAN AND WITH THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN TANKING SUPPORT FOR THE TEA PARTY, THE REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT IS TRYING TO PUT THE ANGRY GENIE IT CREATED BACK IN THE BOTTLE. THEY HAVE LAUNCHED NEW REPUBLICAN MAIN STREET PARTNERSHIP WHICH SEEKS TO RAISE $8 MILLION TO BEAT BACK TEA PARTY CHALLENGES TO MAINSTREAM REPUBLICAN INCUMBENTS. SAID LA TURRET, HOPEFULLY WE&#39;LL GO INTO EIGHT TO TEN RACES AND BEAT THE SNOT OUT OF THEM. KARL ROVE, EVIL GENIUS IN THE 2004 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS ONLY TO BE CAST ASIDE AFTER FAILING SPECTACULARLY IN THE 2012 ELECTION HAS LAUNCHED CONSERVATIVE VICTORY PROJECT. THE GOAL, TO AVOID NOMINATING TEA PARTY CANDIDATES DEEMED UNELECTABLE BY ROVE, THE VERY REPUBLICANS WHO CREATED TEA PARTY MONSTER ARE TRYING THEIR DARNEDEST TO DEFEAT IT. COMING BACK OUT TO THE PANEL, IT SEEMS IRONIC YOU HAD DICK ARMEY&#39;S GROUP LOVED THE TEA PARTY AND GLOMMED ONTO IT, NOW MOST AFRAID OF IT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HATE TO BE NAY SAYER. I WILL BELIEVE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK WHEN I SEE IT. $8 MILLION IS WHAT WE&#39;RE TALKING ABOUT. IF THE ENTIRE BUSINESS COMMUNITY REALLY WANTED TO TAKE DOWN THE TEA PARTY WE WOULD TALK ABOUT TENS OR HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THERE&#39;S NO SHORT SUPPLY OF CASH HERE. THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT A FEW SPECIAL ELECTIONS. I FEEL LIKE THE SAME STORY WITH LABOR AND PROGRESSIVES AGAINST DEMOCRATS. THEY MAKE A LOT OF NOISE BUT I&#39;M WAITING TO SEE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT SOUNDS LIKE DR. EVIL, $8 MILLION, IT&#39;S NOT THAT MUCH MONEY. IT&#39;S TRUE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE SPENDING ON THE TEA PARTY SIDE AND AGGRESSIVENESS, IT ISN&#39;T JUST THE MONEY. THESE TEA PARTY GROUPS, SENATE CONSERVATIVES, THEY ARE EXTREMELY AGGRESSIVE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THEY ARE VERY AGGRESSIVE. REMEMBER IN 2010 ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS WERE KIND OF EXCITED BY THE TEA PARTY BECAUSE THEY REPRESENTED ENERGY AND REPRESENT, RIGHT, MOTIVATED. THEN THEY WERE LIKE UH-OH, THEY ARE REALLY MOTIVATED, THEY HAVE A LOT OF ENERGY AND THEY ARE CRAZY. THAT&#39;S WHAT THEY FIGURED OUT. WHAT I WANT TO TAKE US BACK TO. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; GOD WAS ON THEIR SIDE VERY MUCH. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IN 2010 AS THIS MOVEMENT WAS SPREADING, I THINK ALL OF US MISSED WHAT WAS GOING ON. IT TOOK A WHILE FOR PEOPLE TO FOCUS ON THE FACT THERE WAS ASTA ASTROTURF PIECE AND SOME GENUINELY BELIEVED WHAT THEY ARE SAYING. WHEN SOME FOLKS CAME OUT AND SAY CRAZY THINGS, FORGET THEY WERE THERE IN 2010 AS WELL. WE GLOSSED IT OVER BECAUSE BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENED, FREEDOM WORKS CAME UP ON TOP OF IT AND MADE IT LOOK AND FEEL LIKE THIS BIG, NATIONAL ENERGIZING MOMENT FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I STILL REMEMBER IN 2008 AT SOME OF THOSE SARAH PALIN RALLIES, HAD PEOPLE WITH CURIOUS GEORGE DOLLS, IMAGES OF BARACK OBAMA AS A TERRORIST AND YELLING OUT FRIGHTENING THINGS. THERE WAS ALREADY A NATION RAGE RUMBLING UNDERNEATH REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT AND THE TEA PARTY GROUP SORT OF GRABBED IT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NO ONE FLEW GADSDEN FLAGS, THE YELLOW FLAG WITH SNAKE ON IT WHERE I&#39;M FROM UNTIL BARACK OBAMA RAN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. TEA PARTY WASN&#39;T TEA PARTY UNTIL BARACK OBAMA RAN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I DON&#39;T THINK IT WAS ALL BECAUSE OF BARACK OBAMA. I THINK MUCH OF IT WAS GEORGE BUSH. DICK ARMEY, FORMER HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER WHO SHEPHERDED THROUGH TENS OF HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF SPENDING ON THE HOUSE FLOOR. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; OF PORK. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I&#39;M COMPLETELY BEHIND AS A FORMER STAFFER, EVERYONE GOES WAIT A MINUTE. I REMEMBER HIM SENDING WHEN I WALKED FOR CARL ICAHN, THE BILLIONAIRE, I SENT A LET TOTER SAYING WE WANT HIM TO GIVE US MILLIONS. I THREW IT AWAY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; TRYING TO KEEP THE BLUE SHIP HEALTH CARE PLAN BECAUSE HE DIDN&#39;T WANT TO TRADE IT IN FOR MEDICARE. THIS ISN&#39;T WHAT YOU WOULD THINK OF A GRASSROOTS TEA PARTY GUY. THEY WERE ABLE TO CAPITALIZE ON IT. SOME HAD GOP OFFICES SHARING THE SAME SPACE. IT&#39;S COMING BACK TO BITE THEM FROM BEHIND. THEY USED IT AND NEEDED IT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; DICK ARMEY IS NO LONGER WITH FREEDOM WORKS, WE SHOULD ADD. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SECONDLY TO YOUR POINT I&#39;M SURE KOCH BROTHERS THOUGHT THE $8 MILLION WAS CUTE. THAT&#39;S ADORABLE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHILE YOU&#39;RE TALKING ABOUT THE CUTENESS, CAN I SHOW YOU HOW CUTE IT IS. THE DIFFERENCE IN SPENDING, AMERICANS FOR PROR PETER $36 MILLION, FREEDOM WORKS $19 MILLION, AMERICAN CROSS WORKS $104 MILLION OF OTHER PEOPLE&#39;S MONEY THAT KARL ROVE BLEW. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THERE IS HOPE, THEORIZING LAST SHUTDOWN WILL HAVE ALTERED THE DYNAMICS HERE IN WHICH BASICALLY REPUBLICANS SAY, MAN, WHAT HAVE WE DONE. WE&#39;RE RISKING PERSONAL BOTTOM LINES BY SUPPORTING THESE POLITICIANS. I&#39;M SKEPTICAL AS YOU ARE. WE&#39;LL WAIT TO BELIEVE IT. IF YOU LOOK DOWN THE LINE, THE CLUB FOR GROWTH, I DON&#39;T UNDERSTAND. IT SEEMS TO ME THEY ARE MORE IN LINE WITH OBAMA. THEY SUPPORT IMMIGRATION REFORM. THEY DON&#39;T WANT TO SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT, FLIRT WITH DEFAULT. ON THE MAJOR SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES OF THE DAY THEY SEEM TO BE IN LINE WITH THE PRESIDENT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ISN&#39;T THAT BECAUSE BUSH REPUBLICANS -- GEORGE BUSH STARTED OUT THE GATE WE&#39;VE GOT TO BE IMMIGRATION REFORM, A PUSH FOR MORE HISPANICS IN THE PARTY THEY ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF STEP WITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; DEPENDS WHICH ISSUES YOU PRIORITIZE. FOR A LOT OF GUYS TEA PARTY IS GOOD DEAL. THEY ARE EMBARRASSING BUT REGULATION, TAXES, STUFF THAT HITS YOUR POCKETBOOK -- &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE MOST ACTIVE VOTERS IN REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES. IF YOU&#39;RE RUNNING A PRESIDENTIAL, EVEN A SENATE CAMPAIGN WHERE STATEWIDE YOU&#39;RE THINKING I&#39;M GOING TO HAVE TO APPEAL TO SOME OTHER PEOPLE THAN THE WHITE FOLKS IN THIS STATE, THEY VOTE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN MAKING DIRTY DEALS WITH THEIR PEOPLE FOR DECADES. DON&#39;T FORGET WHAT LEE ATWATER DID, HE TAPPED INTO THE THEORY YOU&#39;RE GOING TO GO AND APPEAL TO PEOPLE&#39;S GOD SENSE NATURE, THEIR RELIGIOUS AFFINITY OF THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE YOU&#39;LL GET OUT TO THE POLLS. THE TEA PARTY IS NOTHING MORE THAN A NATURAL BLOSSOM OFF OF THAT. BY THE WAY, BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU ASK FOR. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S INTERESTING THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MARRY THAT RELIGIOUS FERVOR ALONG WITH THE IDEA OF STICKING IT TO THE POOR, THE OPPOSITE OF THE JESUS MESSAGE. YOU CAN&#39;T FORGET -- I HAVE THIS QUOTE I HAVE TO PULL OUT, NIXON STRATEGIST, KEVIN PHILLIPS WHO SAID MORE OUTRAGEOUS THINGS ABOUT WHAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY NEEDED TO DO TO GRAB THE SOUTH, TAKE THE SOUTH AWAY FROM DEMOCRATS, THE AUTHOR OF EMERGING REPUBLICAN AUTHORITY. HE SAID, THE MORE NEGROES THAT REGISTER DEMOCRATS, THE SOONER NEGROPHOBE WHITES WILL QUIT DEMOCRATS. THEY ARE SO SUCCESSFUL SNATCHING AWAY THE DIXIE SOUTH NOW THEY ARE STICK WITH IT. THEY HAVE A PARTY MONOCHROMATIC AND IDEA LOGICALLY MONOCHROMATIC. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HERE IS THE PROBLEM. THOSE WHITE PEOPLE DIE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOT FROM DEATH PANELS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; OKAY. COMING UP -- &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ON THAT HIGH NOTE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; A REPUBLICAN ELECTION OFFICIAL IN NORTH CAROLINA HAS REPORTEDLY BEEN FORCED TO RESIGN IN THE WAKE OF HIS OFFENSIVE INTERVIEW WITH THE DALY SHOW.

IN A REPEAT OF 2010 DEMOCRATS UP FOR RE-ELECTION IN THE MIDTERMS VOTED IN THE SPRING ONLY TO ABANDON THERE IN THE WHITE HOUSE SIGNATURE ACHIEVEMENT IN DROVES BY FALL THE UNPRECEDENTED UNITY DISPLAYED DURING THE SHUTDOWN FIGHT SEEMS TO BE UNRAVELING. CALL IT THE GREAT FREAKOUT OVER OBAMA CARE. A CLEAR POLITICAL MANEUVER BY VULNERABLE DEMOCRATS TO I THINK SO LATE THEMSELVES FROM AN UNPOPULAR NATIONAL STORY. TODAY NINE DEMOCRATIC SENATORS JOINED TO ENCOURAGE EXTENDING ENROLLMENT BEYOND THE DEADLINE. IT&#39;S UNSURE IF IT WILL AFFECT ADMINISTRATION POSITIONING. AFTER ALL THE WHITE HOUSE IS USED TO FIGHTING BATTLING ON ITS OWN. YESTERDAY IF THEY WERE CONCERNED THEY WEREN&#39;T SHOWING IT. TYPICAL OF THE LONGVIEW THAT OBAMA TENDS TO TAKE, WHITE HOUSE AIDES SAY, HE DIDN&#39;T BELIEVE LAST WEEK&#39;S SHUTDOWN VICTORY WOULD SUDDENLY TRANSFORM HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH HILL DEMOCRATS. NEITHER IS HE WORRIED BY THIS WEEK&#39;S REBELLION. HARRY REID IS URGING CALM, STRONGLY DISPUTING THE IDEA THE LAW IS BECOMING A POLITICAL LIABILITY FOR DEMOCRATS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK QUITE THE CONTRARY. I THINK IT&#39;S A GREAT ASSET FOR DEMOCRATS. THEY HAVE TRIED 45 TIMES TO DO THE SAME THING, AND THEY LOST EVERY TIME TO DEFUND OBAMA CARE. NOW WE HAVE A NEW DEAL. WHAT WE&#39;RE GOING TO DO IS HOLD A BUNCH OF HEARINGS AND TRY TO EMBARRASS THE PRESIDENT THIS WAY. ALL THEIR YELLING AND SCREAMING ABOUT OBAMA CARE, WHAT IS THEIR ALTERNATIVE IN THEY DON&#39;T HAVE ONE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT CAME AFTER NANCY PELOSI MADE IT CLEAR SHE BELIEVES IT WAS THE BANK BAILOUT AFFECTIONATELY KNOWN AS T.A.R.P. AND NOT OBAMA CARE THAT TORPEDOED THEM IN 2010. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I DON&#39;T BUY INTO THE IDEA WE LOST THE ELECTION BECAUSE OF THE HEALTH CARE. ONE OF THE MOST DAMAGING VOTES OUR MEMBERS HAD TO TAKE WAS THE T.A.R.P. THAT WAS REALLY THE VOTE THAT SORT OF SOURED PEOPLE. THEY DIDN&#39;T LIKE THAT VOTE AT ALL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; STILL EVEN AS SOME RED STATE DEMOCRATS GO TO SURVIVAL MODE NOT ALL ARE CLIMBING ABOARD THE FREAKOUT TRAIN. ONE SAID, IF JEANNE SHAHEEN THINKS IT HELPS HER IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, THEN YOU KNOW WHAT? GO DO IT. PAM STEIN, POLITICAL REPORTER AT NATIONAL JOURNEY ALEX WALL, MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR JIMY WILLIAMS AND HOST OF MSNBC&#39;S DISRUPT KAREN FINNEY. I&#39;M GOING TO YOU FIRST SINCE I DID THE DISRUPT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND I&#39;M THE ONLY ONWOMAN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THEY AREN&#39;T EXACTLY AN ARMY OF STRENGTH. WHEN ANY GLITCH OR A MEDIA FRENZY THAT MAKES IT UNCOMFORTABLE, THEY RUN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I DISAGREE WITH HYPERBOLE. THESE ARE DEMOCRATS VULNERABLE IN TOUGH RACES, TOUGH STATES FRCH FROM A RECEIPT OR CALIPER SUSPECTIVE IT&#39;S GOOD FOR THEM. THEY SUPPORT AFFORDABLE CARE ACT OVERALL. NOT LIKE THEY ARE DEFECTING AND IN THE TED CRUZ CAMP AND CALLING FOR REPEAL AND REPLACE. I THINK THERE&#39;S LESS HYSTERIA AROUND THIS. I THINK WE LIKE TO FIND WHERE THE FRACTURES ARE BUT NOT GOING TO MAKE A BIG DEAL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THERE IS 10 DEMOCRATS WHO SENT THIS LETTER TO KATHLEEN SEBELIUS. GIVEN THE EXISTING PROBLEMS WITH HEALTHCARE.GOV AND OTHER STATE RUN MARKETS THAT DEPEND ON THE WEBSITE WE URGE YOU TO CONSIDER EXTENDING OPEN ENROLLMENT I DON&#39;T KNOW MAR 31. INDIVIDUALS SHOULD NOT BE PENALIZED FOR LACK OF COVERAGE IF THEY ARE UNABLE TO PURCHASE HEALTH INSURANCE DUE TO TECHNICAL PROBLEMS. THERE&#39;S SEVEN UP FOR RE-ELECTION. THERE&#39;S SOME SURPRISES SHEEHAN, PRYOR IN ARKANSAS, RED STATES, HAGAN, UDALL IN COLORADO, TOM UDALL IN NEW MEXICO. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, A SURPRISE BECAUSE SHE&#39;S IN CALIFORNIA WHERE EXCHANGES ARE WORKING. BENNETT IN COLORADO, HEINRICH IN NEW MEXICO. THOSE THREE NOT UP FOR RE-ELECTION. WHAT IS BEHIND DEMOCRATS TO DO A FULL EMBRACE AND DO WHAT THEY DID WITH SHUTDOWN AND HANG TOGETHER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ALL POLITICS ARE LOCAL. YOU&#39;RE FINDING SENATORS, MOST IN CYCLE. THEY ARE LOOKING AT THEIR STATE AND SAYING I DON&#39;T WANT THAT EXTRA HEADACHE. WHY SHOULD THEY -- AS A DEMOCRAT AND BY THE WAY, SWO SOMEONE WHO SIGNED UP FOR OBAMA CARE, I DON&#39;T HAVE A PROBLEM MOVING THIS. IF THAT&#39;S WHAT IT TAKES, FINE. LETS THEM GET RE-ELECTED, FINE. SHOULDN&#39;T MARY LANDRIEU REPRESENT THE STATE OF LOUISIANA THE BEST WAY SHE CAN. LET HER DO THAT DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS IS NOT MONOLITHIC. THAT&#39;S JUST NOT HOW THEY ROLL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; PART OF BIG TEN POLITICS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; FIRST OF ALL, GOOD LUCK WITH THE OBAMA DEATH PANELS. IT WAS NICE KNOWING YOU. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ENJOYING THE SEGMENT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SECONDLY, I THINK THERE&#39;S TWO POINTS TO MAKE HERE. ONE IS JIMMY&#39;S POINT, THERE ARE POLICY ISSUES THEY WANT TO CONSIDER. IF YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH ENROLLMENT, WHICH HAPPENED. IF THAT&#39;S GOING TO CARRY INTO MARCH, YOU SHOULDN&#39;T PENALIZE SOMEONE WHO CAN&#39;T HAVE ACCESS TO INSURANCE BECAUSE THEY CAN HAVE ACCESS TO INSURANCE. THAT&#39;S ONE. TWO, THIS IS NOT UNIQUE. A LOT OF THESE SAME DEMOCRATS WANTED TO DELAY INDIVIDUAL MANDATE OR TALK ABOUT DELAYING ENROLLMENT DURING THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. HOWEVER, THEY WERE NEVER GOING TO DO IT WITH THE THREAT OF SHUTDOWN UPON THEM, CERTAINLY WASN&#39;T WITH THE DEBT LIMIT DEBATE. IT&#39;S NOT LIKE THIS IS BUBBLING TO THE SURFACE. THERE WAS CONCERN AND ANXIETY BEFORE, WE&#39;RE JUST IN A DIFFERENT CONTEXT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IS THE RIGHT POLITICS FOR THE WHITE HOUSE TO ASEED TO WIBS OF WHITE HOUSE. IT&#39;S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR WHITE HOUSE AND DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS. IS THE RIGHT PLAY FOR THE WHITE HOUSE TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT, WE&#39;LL GIVE YOU ADDITIONAL DELAY WHICH WOULD GIVE CUSHION TO THE SEVEN OF TEN UP FOR RE-ELECTION. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; TOO EARLY TO TELL. SEE HOW IT WILL WORK. A COUPLE OF DAYS OR WEEK OR TWO TO FIX, STICK WITH THE CURRENT PLAN. IF NOT, THIS IS AN ENTIRELY REASONABLE POLICY. THIS IS THE WAY NANCY PELOSI RAN THE HOUSE MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN JOHN BOEHNER DID. SHE KNEW THERE WERE RED STATE DEMOCRATS THAT WOULD NOT LIKE VOTES AND SHE WOULD LET THEM GO WHEN SHE GOT TO THE LEVEL SHE NEEDED. IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND HERE, THEM SAYING WE NEED TO DO THIS, SPLASHING WATER ON OBAMA CARE DOESN&#39;T MATTER. THEY NEEDED VOTES ON THE SHUTDOWN. THAT&#39;S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IT TOGETHER. THIS IS RHETORIC ESSENTIALLY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BESIDES THE FACT AT THE END OF THE DAY IF THE ROLLOUT GOES AS PLANNED, BY MARCH, APRIL, MAY, JUNE, PEOPLE SIGNING UP, THIS WEBSITE GLITCH STORY WILL BE IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR. IN MASSACHUSETTS, THE EXAMPLE, WE HAVE A CHART THAT SHOWS IT DRAMATICALLY, YOU HAD VERY FEW PEOPLE SIGNING UP IN THE BEGINNING ANYWAY. IT WAS REALLY TOWARDS THE END WHEN OUT TO THE DEADLINE THAT THE BULK OF PEOPLE SIGNED ON. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S PART OF WHY THIS QUESTION, DO YOU PUSH BACK THE DEADLINE FOR PEOPLE TO SIGN UP BASED ON IF YOU THINK THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH TIME OR DO YOU ASSUME PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY IS GOING TO DO IT AT THE LAST MINUTE ANYWAY. I ALSO THINK, LETS NOT LOSE THE FOREST FOR THE TREES. THIS IS ONE PART OF HEALTH CARE REFORM. I DON&#39;T WANT US TO LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACT IT IS MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE&#39;S LIVES ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. YES, THE WEBSITE HAS BEEN PROBLEMATIC. BUT GEEZ, THAT&#39;S ONE THING IN THE SCOPE OF SOMETHING THAT WILL LITERALLY CHANGE THE COUNTRY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S SUCH AN IMPORTANT POINT. PARTICULARLY IN SOUTHERN STATES NOT DOING EXCHANGES, RELYING ON FEDERAL EXCHANGES AND EXPANDING MEDICAID, IT&#39;S A HUGE PART OF AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, NOT JUST WEBSITE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THERE&#39;S A POLITICAL THING TO THIS WE&#39;RE TALKING ABOUT. EVERY SENATOR ALL VOTED FOR OBAMA CARE. SO THE HOUSE IS GOING TO BE USED AGAINST THEM. PLAYING THIS LIKE SAYING DELAY THE MANDATE IF YOU WILL IS VERY SMART FOR THEM. THAT&#39;S POLITICS. FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE, I THINK YOU HAVE TO LET THE THING WORK. KAREN IS RIGHT. THIS IS A SLIVER OF IT. I WAS THOROUGHLY IRRITATED BY THE FACT IT TOOK ME THREE WEEKS TO DO IT. I HAD TO PICK UP THE PHONE AND CALL SOMEBODY. THAT TOOK THREE TIMES. I GOT IT DONE, NOW I&#39;M GOING TO GO SHOP, FIGURE OUT WHICH PLAN I WANT. I LIVE IN VIRGINIA, A STATE THAT DIDN&#39;T PARTICIPATE, DIDN&#39;T DO MEDICAID EXPANSION, SO I&#39;M IN THE NATIONAL EXCHANGE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S ONE OF THE THINGS I&#39;M CURIOUS ABOUT, WHY THE POLITICS WOULDN&#39;T ALSO, ALEX, BE STATEWIDE ELECTED DEMOCRATS TURNING THE SPOTLIGHT ON THEIR OWN GOVERNORS IN THEIR HOME STATES SAYING MY GOVERNOR IS PREVENTING -- WE DON&#39;T SEE FLORIDA PEOPLE HERE BUT YOU HAVE THE NAVIGATORS, HUMANS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO HELP YOU, BEING THWARTED OR MEDICAID NOT EXPANDED. THAT SEEMS TO BE MISSING FROM THE DEMOCRATIC STRATEGY. LOOK, MY STATE ISN&#39;T DOING THIS RIGHT OR FULLY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. THIS IS INCREDIBLE COGNITIVE DISSIDENT HERE, MEDICARE, LEAVING IT TO THE GOVERNMENT, TURNING AROUND SCREAMING WHEN PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS -- HAVE TROUBLE GETTING ACCESS TO THIS LAW YOU TRIED TO UNDERMINE. STATES DOING IT THEMSELVES LIKE KENTUCKY, IT&#39;S WORKING MUCH BETTER THAN THE FEDERAL PROGRAM. I WONDER IF YOU&#39;RE GOING TO START TO SEE THAT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YET INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE AT TURNING NARRATIVE 100% TO THE WEBSITE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I COMPLETELY AGREE. THERE&#39;S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR DEMOCRATS HERE THAT I HOPE THEY DON&#39;T PASS UP. I&#39;M 50/50. MORALLY THIS IS DISGUSTING. WE SHOULD BE SHAMING THESE GOVERNORS. BASICALLY THEY ARE PUTTING IDEOLOGY ABOVE THE HEALTH CARE OF THEIR PEOPLE, POOREST PEOPLE. IN ADDITION TO THAT BY NOT BEING PART OF CREATING THEIR OWN EXCHANGE. IN KENTUCKY PART OF WHAT THEY KNOW IS WHAT DO PEOPLE IN KENTUCKY NEED THE MOST. LETS MAKE SURE IT SUITS OUR PEOPLE. FEDERAL EXCHANGE IS MINE IN OTHER PLACES. SOME STATES GOVERNORS ARE BASICALLY SAYING -- &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I WILL AGREE WITH KAREN, ADMINISTRATION HANDING A BURDEN THEY CAN&#39;T ANTICIPATE WHEN STATES SAID YOU&#39;RE ON THE EXCHANGE. THAT SAID I DON&#39;T THINK THE ADMINISTRATION SHOULD GET THAT MUCH OF A PASS ON THIS. THEY PUT A PROMISE OUT TO 7 MILLION OR SO PEOPLE SUPPOSED TO BUY INSURANCE FROM THE EXCHANGE THEY WOULD HAVE ACCESS, GET THE MEDICAL COVERAGE THEY NEEDED AND THEY HAVE NOT DELIVERED. THAT IS A FACT. THE ADMINISTRATION SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THAT. I WILL SAY THIS. IT IS CREATING AN IMAGE FOR THEM THAT&#39;S NOT A GOOD ONE, WHICH IS THEY CANNOT ADMINISTER THIS PRESIDENT&#39;S SIGNATURE DOMESTIC ACHIEVEMENT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I DON&#39;T DISAGREE WITH YOU ON THAT BUT I DON&#39;T WANT US TO LOSE SIGHT ON WHAT THE REPUBLICANS BLOCKING THIS HAVE DONE. IT IS REALLY MORALLY DISGUSTING. THEY SHOULD NOT GET A PASS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; MEDICAID EXPANSION. IRONICALLY THEY ARE TURNING AROUND SAYING -- &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BIG DEAL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I KNOW. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE OTHER ISSUE ON THE EXCHANGES SPECIFICALLY, THE VERY STATES THAT SAID WE DON&#39;T LIKE THE BIG, BAD FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT COME AND RUN OUR EXCHANGE, THEN WE&#39;RE GOING TO UNDERMINE THE EXPERIMENT ANY WAY WE CAN, IT&#39;S SORT OF IRONIC WHAT THEY ARE DEMONSTRATING TO THEIR OWN PEOPLE IN THEIR STATES, LOOK, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN&#39;T DO IT. WE DON&#39;T WANT THEM TO. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SOME OF THESE RED STATE GOVERNORS ACKNOWLEDGE PART OF THEIR GOAL WAS TO PUT ADDITIONAL PRESSURE ON THE FEDERAL SYSTEM WITH THE ASSUMPTION PEOPLE WOULD GO ON AND HAVE A TOUGH EXPERIENCE. I DON&#39;T AGREE WITH SAM, THE FACT THEY HAVE HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE IN SOME CASES IS PROBLEMATIC. PERSONALLY I THINK IT IS DISGUSTING THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAD TO GO OUT ON MONDAY AND DEFEND THIS THING. BUT AT THE SAME TIME I JUST KEEP GOING BACK TO PEOPLE ARE GETTING HEALTH CARE. YOU CAN&#39;T LOSE SIGHT OF THAT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AT SOME POINT, I THINK THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE PRESIDENT WILL BE THE PRESIDENT UNTIL 2016. NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO, THIS LAW WILL BE THE LAW, UNTIL 2016. THEY HAVE TO AT SOME POINT SAY HOW CAN WE MAKE THIS LAW BETTER IN OUR OWN VISION, OUR OWN IDEOLOGY. THEY ARE NOT THERE YET. THEY STILL WANT TO GET RID ENTIRELY. AT SOME POINT THEY HAVE TO COME TO THAT REALIZATION. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE IRONY IS IN THE STATE, THE STATES REJECTING IT, THEY COULD OWN IT AS AN ISSUE, THE FEDERALISM THEY DREAM OF, ENTIRELY A STATE MATTER. THEY ARE THE ONES INTRODUCING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INTO IT. AFTER THE BREAK, AS WACKO BIRD TED CRUZ FLIES OFF TO IOWA, THE REPUBLICAN EMPIRE STRIKES BACK.

I FEEL LIKE THIS IS A FASCINATING SIDE OF THE PRESIDENCY AND AMERICAN PUBLIC LIFE. I WONDER IF YOU CAN TELL US HOW YOU BEGAN SENDING DEVOTIONALS TO THE PRESIDENT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHEN I FIRST STARTED DOING THIS I HAD NO IDEA I WOULD BE AN ADVISER. I WAS ON THE CAMPAIGN DOING OUTREACH TO THE FAITH COMMUNITY. I LOOKED AT HIM AND SAW HE HAD ALL SORTS OF SUPPORT AROUND HIM, POLICY ADVISERS AND POLITICAL SUPPORT BUT I WONDER WHO WAS THINKING ABOUT HIS SPIRIT, WHO WAS THINKING ABOUT HIS SOUL, SO TOOK A STEP OUT THERE AND SENT HIM AN E-MAIL. I DIDN&#39;T KNOW IF I WAS ALLOWED TO SEND A SENATOR A PERSONAL E-MAIL. IT WAS A MEDITATION ON 23rd PSALM ON FINDING REST IN TOUGH TIME AND HELD MY BREATH. HE WROTE BACK AND SAID THAT&#39;S EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR. THAT&#39;S HOW IT STARTED WAY BACK IN THE DAY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S ONE THING TO HAVE SPIRITUAL TEXTS SENT TO YOU AND ABSORB THEM BUT DO YOU THINK HE SEEKS OUT OR YEARNS FOR IT AND YEARNS FOR THAN NOW. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE PRESIDENT IS A COMMITTED CHRISTIAN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WAIT, HE&#39;S A COMMITTED CHRISTIAN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE PRESIDENT IS A COMMITTED CHRISTIAN. HE&#39;S VERY CAREFUL ABOUT CULTIVATING HIS FAITH. HE DOESN&#39;T WEAR IT ON HIS SLEEVE. I&#39;D RATHER HAVE A LEADER WHO LIVES OUT A SERMON INSTEAD OF PREACHES ONE. HE TRIES TO DO THAT AS A GOOD FATHER, WORKS IN THE WHITE HOUSE THROUGH INTEGRITY AND CARE. THAT&#39;S THE WAY HE LIVES OUT HIS FAITH. IT ISN&#39;T SOMETHING HE PREACHES FROM THE ROOFTOP BUT HE IS A SPIRITUAL CHRISTIAN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU ALSO HAVE EMILY DICKINSON, BOB DYLAN. HOW DID THAT BEGIN? WERE YOU SEARCHING FOR NEW MATERIAL, OR THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO SORT OF SEEKS -- HE CONSUMES INFORMATION. I THINK A LOVER OF CULTURE. HOW DID THOSE GET WORKED INTO DEVOTIONALS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE PRESIDENT LOVES TWO THINGS, HISTORY AND JAZZ. I TRY TO WEAVE IN THOSE THINGS, NINA SIMONE, MEDITATIONS ABOUT ABRAHAM LINCOLN, HOW HE DEALT WITH ENEMIES AND FOLKS WHO WERE TOUGH TO FIND COMMON GROUND W I TRIED TO FIND SOURCES OF INSPIRATION THAT MEANT SOMETHING TO THE PRESIDENT AND HOPEFULLY TO OTHER PEOPLE AS WELL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE TALK ABOUT SORT OF CULTURAL STEREOTYPES IN THIS COUNTRY. TO A LARGE DEGREE THE RIGHT AND CONSERVATIVES HAVE OWNED THE MANTLE OF THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT AND CHRISTIANITY. IF YOU LOOK AT PROGRESSIVE POLICY IT&#39;S MORE IN LINE WITH GOOD CHRISTIAN IDEAS. CAN YOU GO BACK TO CONFERENCE OF CATHOLIC BISHOPS CAME OUT AGAINST THE PAUL RYAN BUDGET AND SAID THIS IS NOT MORAL OR SISTER SIMO SIMO SIMONE, THOSE ON THE LEFT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S PARTICULARLY STRANGE GIVEN HOW MUCH CHURCHES WERE A PART OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND ALSO FOR JEWISH AMERICANS REALLY COMPELLED TO FIND SOLIDARITY IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT THROUGH THEIR FAITH. IT&#39;S BEEN A LONG STRAIN IN PROGRESSIVISM. WE SEE A LOT OF CHANGES IN AMERICANS, PARTICULARLY GENERATIONAL, A LOT OF CHANGES IN HOW AMERICANS TRUST RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS. YOU&#39;RE SEEING A LOT OF CHANGE IN EVANGELICAL BASE WITH THIS YOUNG GENERATION REALLY NOT WANTING BIG CHURCHES IN POLITICS. FUNDAMENTAL LIP WE&#39;RE ALL LOOKING FOR HIGHER MEANING IN LIFE. IT&#39;S GREAT YOU&#39;RE DOING THIS FOR THE PRESIDENT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; JOSHUA, IN TERMS OF RELIGIOUS TEXT, HAS IT LARGELY BEEN LIMITED TO THE BIBLE? DO YOU LOOK AT OTHER HOLY BOOKS FOR INSPIRATION. I&#39;M NOT TRYING TO FUEL BIRTHERISM BUT IN TERMS OF HIS FAITHFULNESS AND SPIRITUALITY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IN TERMS OF RELIGIOUS TEXT, IT IS BASED IN THE BIBLE, MEANT TO CULTIVATE HIS FAITH AND HE HAPPENS TO BE A CHRISTIAN. THERE&#39;S SOMETHING IN HERE FOR EVERYONE. WE NEED TO START OUR DAY WITH PURPOSE AND JOY AND HOW TO GET THROUGH TOUGH TIMES WITH THE BEST SPIRIT POSSIBLE. THAT&#39;S WHAT THE BOOK IS FOCUSED ON. I THINK THERE&#39;S SOMETHING HERE FOR PEOPLE OF ALL DIFFERENT FAITHS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I FEEL LIKE I&#39;M GOING TO READ A PAGE EVERY DAY NOT THAT MY JOB IS ANYWHERE NEAR AS HARD AS THE PRESIDENT. IT&#39;S SFWG AND GREAT AND USEFUL BOOK, TOO. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. I&#39;LL WAKE YOU UP AT 5:30 WITH AN E-MAIL TO YOUR BLACKBERRY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; JOSHUA DUBOIS, THANK YOU. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THANK YOU TO OUR PABLO.","media$content":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":329.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":0,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/ImZUCxKemB5o?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":0,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"media$thumbnails":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"image","plfile$duration":0.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"JPEG","plfile$height":1080,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_wag_d_131024.jpg","plfile$width":1920,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"link":"","pubDate":1382638560000,"plmedia$defaultThumbnailUrl":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_wag_d_131024.jpg","nnd$associatedPlaylist":{"href":"http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_18424734"},"nnd$brand":"MSNBC","nnd$bureau":"30RockNY","nnd$bviAssetId":"n_wag_d_131024","nnd$canonicalUrl":{"href":"http://www.msnbc.com/now-with-alex-wagner/watch/365-days-of-prayer-for-obama-in-new-book-56158275538"},"nnd$distributionProfile":["MSN-CA"],"nnd$firstAiredAtUtc":1382633496000,"nnd$lastAiredAtUtc":1382633496000,"nnd$lastEditorialChangeAtUtc":1382638598000,"nnd$longTitle":"365 days of prayer for Obama in new book","nnd$playCount30":2699,"nnd$playCountDay":7,"nnd$playCountYear":2693,"nnd$requiresCaptioning":true,"nnd$shortDescription":"Josh Dubios was the director of faith outreach at the White House, and his new book features 365 prayers sent to President Obama.","nnd$source":"NOW","nnd$sourceId":"nnd_45258737","nnd$sourceUrlSlug":"now-with-alex-wagner","nnd$titleUrlSlug":"365-days-of-prayer-for-obama-in-new-book","nnd$videoType":"Broadcast","nnd$workbenchId":"53363481"},{"$xmlns":{"nnd":"http://partners.nbcnews.com/nnd_mrss"},"guid":"n_wag_c_131024","title":"Dems, GOP set to take up farm bill","author":"","description":"Next week, Dems and the GOP will go to conference on the farm bill, where the two sides will attempt to iron out their enormous differences.

THE BIGGEST OF ALL, FOOD STAMPS KNOWN AS S.N.A.P. REPRESENTATIVES LIKE STEPHEN FINCHER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE BIBLE ALSO SAYS THE POOR WILL ALWAYS BE WITH US. IT ALSO SAYS IF YOU DON&#39;T WORK, YOU DON&#39;T EAT. MORE THAN THAT, THE ROLE OF CITIZENS, OF CHRISTIANS OF HUMANITY IS TO TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER BUT NOT FOR WASHINGTON TO STEAL MONEY FROM THOSE IN THE COUNTRY AND GIVE IT TO OTHERS IN THE COUNTRY. WE&#39;RE NOT GOING DOWN THAT ROAD ANYMORE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NEVER MIND A FINCHER, A FARMER ELECTED FROM TEA PARTY SUPPORT HIMSELF COLLECTED $1.5 MILLION IN 2012 FARM SUBSIDIES. BACK IN JUNE HOUSE FARM BILL WENT DOWN IN FLAMES BECAUSE IT DIDN&#39;T CUT ENOUGH FROM FOOD STAMPS TO SATISFY CONSERVATIVE APPETITES. THAT PROMPTED REPUBLICANS LED BY ERIC CANTOR TO DOUBLE THE CUTS. ALONG WITH CUTS REPUBLICANS SEEM TO HAVE LOST EMPATHY GENE WHILE DEMOCRATS AND ECONOMISTS SEE THE GROWTH OF THE FOOD STAMP PROGRAM AS A NATURAL RESULT OF RECESSION AND HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT REPUBLICANS SEE FOOD ASSISTANCE AS PARASITIC ABUSE OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS. THEY GROUND THESE IN ACCUSATIONS OF FOOD STAMP FRAUD. FOOT STAMP FRAUD ACCOUNTS FOR 1% OF THE PROGRAM, FAR LESS THAN THE FRAUD INVOLVED IN FARM SUBSIDIES. THE FACTS HAVE NOT STOPPED THE GRAND OLE PARTY IN ITS ZEAL TO SHRED SOCIAL SAFETY NET. AFTER THE HOUSE TOOK $40 BILLION FROM S.N.A.P., HUELSKAMP ANNOUNCED -- THE PROBLEM, FOOD STAMP RECIPIENTS ARE SITTING ON THE COUCH. 60% INCLUDE A CHILD, ELDERLY OR DISABLED PERSON. 40% OF HOUSEHOLDS RECEIVING FOOD STAMPS HAD WORKING ADULTS IN THEM. THE PROBLEM IS NOT THAT ADULTS ARE GETTING LAZIER, IT&#39;S THAT GETTING BY IS GETTING HARDER. AS SENATE ON POLICY PRIORITIES REMINDS US, MORE AMERICANS ON FOOD STAMPS, GROWING SHARE OF NATION&#39;S WORKERS, HAVING A JOB HAS NOT BEEN ENOUGH TO KEEP THEM OUT OF POVERTY. JOINING ME DEMOCRATIC SENATOR FROM VERMONT AND CHAIR OF SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. SENATOR, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. IT&#39;S A PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SENATOR, WE KNOW YOU&#39;RE GOING TO CONFERENCE ON THREE DIFFERENT BILLS. I THINK THERE&#39;S SOME CONSTERNATION OR CONCERN IN PROGRESSIVE CIRCLES ABOUT HOW YOU SQUARE ONE BILL THAT HAS NO FUNDING FOR SNAP, ONE BILL CUTS BY $39 BILLION AND THE SENATE FARM BILL THAT CUTS BY $4 BILLION. SEEMS THE REPUBLICANS HAVE MOVED THE GOALPOST. ARE YOU CONFIDENT YOU CAN GO TO CONFERENCE AND COME OUT WITH SOMETHING REASONABLE IN TERMS OF CUTS TO S.N.A.P.? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE&#39;RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING REASONABLE IN STANDARD &amp; POOR&#39;S OR WE&#39;RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A FARM BILL. SOME OF THESE SAME HOUSE MEMBERS WHO HAVE SUPPORTED ENORMOUS SUBSIDIES FOR WELL HEELED AGRI BUSINESSES, THOSE THAT PAID FOR WELL-HEELED LOBBYISTS, THEY ARE NOT GOING TO GET THINGS THEY THINK THEY CUT OUT THE MOST DEFENSELESS PEOPLE IN AMERICA. IT&#39;S NOT GOING TO PASS. I WOULD SUGGEST THEY LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE SENATE. WE BROUGHT REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS TOGETHER. MOST OF US ON THE SENATE AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE HAVE BEEN THERE A LONG TIME. MANY OF US IN BOTH PARTIES SERVED AS CHAIR OF THAT COMMITTEE. WE KNEW HOW TO DO IT RIGHT. WE PASS IT THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY, ACTUALLY BRING UP AMENDMENTS, UP OR DOWN AND PASSING A BILL. WE SAVED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WE ALSO TOOK CARE OF THE MOST DEFENSELESS IN THE COUNTRY. YOU KNOW, WHEN I SEE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE WHO VOTE FOR ENORMOUS GIVEAWAYS TO A PLACE LIKE IRAQ, SOMETHING THAT&#39;S BEEN THE BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY CERTAINLY IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DECADES, AND YET THEY SAY WE&#39;RE NOT GOING TO FEED HUNGRY CHILDREN. COME ON. THEY MAKE THE CUTS THEY WANT TO MAKE IN THE FOOD STAMP PROGRAM OR S.N.A.P. YOU&#39;RE GOING TO HAVE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS OFF THE PROGRAM AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN GOING TO SCHOOL HUNGRY. WHERE ARE THE PEOPLE GOING TO COME FROM? THEY ARE GOING TO CREATE THE JOBS, MAKE THIS COUNTRY GREAT IN THE NEXT GENERATION. IF YOU HAVE HUNGRY CHILDREN, HUNGRY CHILDREN DON&#39;T LEARN. THIS IS AN INVESTMENT IN OUR FUTURE AS WELL AS A MORAL THING TO DO. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SENATOR, I HAVE TO ASK YOU ABOUT ANOTHER WORRISOME DEADLINE, WHICH IS NOVEMBER 1st. STIMULUS ADDED MONEY TO THE FOOD STAMP PROGRAM. BUT ON NOVEMBER 1st, THAT STIMULUS IS EXPECTED TO END MEANING A 15% ACROSS THE BOARD CUT IN S.N.A.P. THAT&#39;S ABOUT $5 BILLION FOR FISCAL YEAR 2014 AND WE&#39;RE STILL TALKING ABOUT CONSERVATIVELY ANOTHER $4 BILLION IN THE SENATE BILL. THAT&#39;S A $9BILLION HIT TO THE FOOD STAMPS PROGRAM AT A TIME OF ECONOMIC INSECURITY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT MEANS WE&#39;VE GOT TO STOP -- INSTEAD OF SPENDING WEEKS ON A FOOLISH, EXPENSIVE, NONPRODUCTIVE SHUTDOWN IN THE GOVERNMENT, WE OUGHT TO BE HERE DOING OUR WORK, GETTING BILLS PASSED, VOTE THEM UP OR DOWN. A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE TO TALK AND TALK AND TALK ABOUT HOW THEY ARE SAVING THE TAS PAIRS MONEY AS THEY WASTE MONEY, WASTE TENS OF BILLIONS, HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND GOVERNMENT SECTOR BY NEEDLESS SHUTDOWN. LETS COME IN HERE AND ACTUALLY DO OUR WORK AND PASS THESE THINGS. THERE&#39;S NO MEMBER OF CONGRESS WHO GOES HUNGRY EXCEPT BY CHOICE. HOW CAN THEY LOOK A CHILD IN THE FACE AND SAY GO TO SCHOOL AND LEARN, MAKE THIS A BETTER COUNTRY. SORRY, YOU&#39;VE GOT TO GO TO SCHOOL HUNGRY. THEY WOULDN&#39;T DO THAT TO THEIR CHILDREN OR GRANDCHILDREN, DON&#39;T DO IT TO AMERICA&#39;S CHILDREN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SENATOR, I&#39;M GOING TO BRING IN OUR FOLKS IN NEW YORK, HEATHER, JIM McGOVERN WHO HAS BEEN GREAT ON FOOD STAMPS AND HAS BEEN ON THIS SHOW, THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST HEARTLESS BILLS I&#39;VE SEEN SPEAKING OF THE CUTS. AS THE SENATOR SAID IT&#39;S ALMOST UNCONSCIONABLE, AMORAL TO SEND CHILDREN -- TO TAKE FOOD OUT OF HUNGRY CHILDREN&#39;S MOUTHS. YET, WE REACHED A POINT IN AMERICAN POLITICS WHERE ONE OF THE GOVERNING PARTIES IS TOTALLY FINE WITH THAT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IN FACT, THOUGH THEY ARE NOT FINE, IT&#39;S WHAT WE HAVE TO ACCEPT AS YOU POINTED OUT. THE RANGE IS ALL ON THE NEGATIVE ON TOP OF THAT 15% CUT. THIS IS GOING TO HAVE AN EFFECT NOT JUST ON FAMILIES AND CHILDREN AND NEIGHBORHOODS BUT ALSO ON OUR ECONOMY OVERALL. FOOD STAMPS ARE ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL STIMULUS PROGRAMS WE HAVE. PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE FOOD STAMPS SPEND THEM DIRECT LIP IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD. UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES MORE THAN A DOLLAR IN BANG FOR YOUR BUCK EVERY DOLLAR YOU SPEND. AS WE SEE CUTS, WE SEE JOB NUMBERS GO DOWN. I DON&#39;T CARE AS MUCH ABOUT THE OVERALL ECONOMIC PICTURE AS MUCH AS I DO THERE ARE CHILDREN HUNGRY, WORKERS NOT ABLE TO FEED THEIR CHILDREN. I WOULD THINK AT LEAST REPUBLICANS WOULD FEEL LIKE THERE&#39;S MAKE PRESSURE TO NOT HAVE JOB LOSS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOT ONLY DO THEY NOT FEEL THAT PRESSURE, JONATHAN, THEY ARE TIM HUELSKAMP, YOU&#39;RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SIT ON YOUR COUCH AND HAVE THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER FEED YOU. THAT 47% IS ALIVE AND WELL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THIS IS A VERY RAW MANIFESTATION OF MAKER VERSUS TAKE SENTIMENTS. TO ME THE JUXTAPOSITION WITH THE FARM PROGRAM. THIS IS THE LEAST JUSTIFIABLE PROGRAM OF ANY SIZE IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, GIVING MONEY TO PEOPLE WHOSE BUSINESS HAPPENS TO BE FARMING AS OPPOSED TO OTHER BUSINESSES HAS NO JUSTIFICATION. REPUBLICANS ARE PROPOSING TO SPEND MORE MONEY ON FARM SUBSIDIES THAN DEMOCRATS AND WHITE HOUSE. REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING YOU&#39;RE NOT SPENDING ENOUGH. WE WANT TO SPEND MORE. IT&#39;S A PROBLEM WITH NO JUSTIFICATION AT ALL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU&#39;VE GOT PEOPLE LIKE STEPHEN FINCHER WITH MILLIONS IN FARM SUBSIDIES DECRYING FOOD STAMPS AS UNCHRISTIAN SOMEHOW. THE LOGIC THERE -- THERE IS NO LOGIC THERE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THERE IS NO LOGIC THERE. THAT QUOTE FROM FINCHER WAS UNBELIEVABLE AND A PERFECT EXPRESSION OF THIS ATTITUDE TOWARD THE SUPPOSED 47%. IT WAS REALLY INCREDIBLE. SOMEHOW, YOU KNOW, WITH REPUBLICANS WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT FRAUD, SOMEHOW IT&#39;S ONLY POOR PEOPLE AND BLACK PEOPLE WHO EVER COMMIT FRAUD IN THIS COUNTRY, VOTER FRAUD, MEDICARE, MEDICAID, FOOD STAMP FRAUD. THOSE ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO EVER COMMIT FRAUD IN THIS COUNTRY, ACCORDING TO REPUBLICANS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SENATOR, INDEPENDENT OF THE MORAL ARGUMENT, THERE&#39;S ALSO THE POLITICAL REALITY. AREAS OF THE COUNTRY THAT ARE MOST IN NEED IN FEEDING PEOPLE HAPPEN TO BE GOP STRONGHOLDS. THERE WOULD SEEM TO BE SOME SORT OF POLITICAL CALCULATION HERE. YOU DON&#39;T WANT TO KNEE CAMP CONSTITUENTS YOU&#39;RE ASKING TO VOTE FOR YOU. DO YOU THINK THERE&#39;S A PAYBACK IF REPUBLICANS GO FORWARD WITH THIS? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I DON&#39;T KNOW. THEY HAVE GERRYMANDERED SO MUCH IN THE HOUSE, THEY FEEL SECURE DOING ANYTHING THEY WANT. WHEN YOU HAVE QUOTE, UNQUOTE, FOOD STAMP PROGRAM IS SOMEHOW UNCHRISTIAN, I BELIEVE CHRIST SPOKE ABOUT FEEDING THE HUNGRY. BUT THIS IS NOT A CASE WHERE LOGIC WINS OUT AS MUCH AS HYPERBOLE AND RHETORIC. IT&#39;S FRUSTRATING PEOPLE WHO VOTE FOR ALL KINDS OF SUBSIDIES EVERYTHING FROM MAJOR MEGA AGRICULTURE BUSINESSES BUT NOT THE HUNGRIEST. I CAN GUARANTEE YOU THIS, THE SENATE WILL NOT ACCEPT A BILL THAT HAS THESE DRACONIAN CUTS IN IT. I KNOW THE CHAIR OF OUR COMMITTEE ESTABLIWILL NOT AND I WILL NOT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO JUSTIFY WHY. WHEN THE POOR ECONOMY AND NEW JOB NUMBERS COME OUT AFTER THIS VERY FOOLISH SHUTDOWN THEY ARE GOING TO BE WORSE, I&#39;M NOT EAGER TO DO THAT. WE&#39;VE GOT TO GET TO CONFERENCE. WE&#39;VE GOT TO START TALKING ABOUT IT. I THINK WE HAD TO PUSH HARD. CUTS ARE IN THERE. THAT WAS A HUGE COMPROMISE AS IT WAS TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. I&#39;M NOT WILLING TO COMPROMISE MORE UNLESS YOU CAN SHOW ME THAT SOMEHOW THESE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SENATOR LEAHY, THANK YOU AS ALWAYS FOR YOUR TIME. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt;&gt; COMING UP, WHEN YOU ARE THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD, SOMETIMES YOU NEED A LITTLE FAITH. WE WILL DECIDE WHEN PRESIDENT","media$content":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":800000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":688.856,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":360,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/OatsFpaWRp4S?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":640,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":500000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":688.856,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":240,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/hmE0OTCGV5gv?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":420,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":688.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":0,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/46TQOv8vKbiU?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":0,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"media$thumbnails":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"image","plfile$duration":0.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"JPEG","plfile$height":1080,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_wag_c_131024.jpg","plfile$width":1920,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"link":"","pubDate":1382638200000,"plmedia$defaultThumbnailUrl":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_wag_c_131024.jpg","nnd$associatedPlaylist":{"href":"http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_18424734"},"nnd$brand":"MSNBC","nnd$bureau":"30RockNY","nnd$bviAssetId":"n_wag_c_131024","nnd$canonicalUrl":{"href":"http://www.msnbc.com/now-with-alex-wagner/watch/dems-gop-set-to-take-up-farm-bill-56157763755"},"nnd$distributionProfile":["MSN-CA"],"nnd$firstAiredAtUtc":1382632412000,"nnd$lastAiredAtUtc":1382632412000,"nnd$lastEditorialChangeAtUtc":1382638220000,"nnd$longTitle":"Dems, GOP set to take up farm bill","nnd$playCount30":2435,"nnd$playCountDay":5,"nnd$playCountYear":2430,"nnd$requiresCaptioning":true,"nnd$shortDescription":"Next week, Dems and the GOP will go to conference on the farm bill, where the two sides will attempt to iron out their enormous differences.

DEMOCRATIC FRUSTRATION FOR THE KANGAROO OR MONKEY COURT QUALITY OF THE HEARING DIDN&#39;T GO UNADDRESSED. FRANKIE PELLON SUMMED IT UP BEST. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WILL THE GENTLEMAN YIELD. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NO I WILL NOT YIELD TO MONKEY COURT. DO WHATEVER YOU WANT, I&#39;M NOT YIELDING. WHY ARE WE GOING DOWN THIS PATH? BECAUSE YOU ARE TRYING TO SQUARE PEOPLE SO THEY DON&#39;T APPLY AND SO THEREFORE THE LEGISLATION GETS DELAYED OR THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT GETS DEFUNDED OR IT&#39;S REPEALED. THAT&#39;S ALL IT IS HOPING PEOPLE WON&#39;T APPLY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; JONATHAN, THE JURY IS OUT, AS THEY SAY, WHETHER IT IS A KANGAROO COURT OR MONKEY COURT. YOU THINK MONKEY COURT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK HE SAW &quot;PLANET OF THE APES&quot; AND I THINK THAT&#39;S WHAT HE&#39;S REFERRING TO. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHAT WOULD BE THE REFERENCE IN TERMS OF THE MONKEY COURT, BECAUSE IT&#39;S A FAMILIAR TERM. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, IN A MONKEY COURT, YOU BASICALLY HAVE A LOT OF APES WHO HAVE TAKEN OVER THE PLANET, WHO ARE TRYING TO KEEP THE HUMANS DOWN. THE HUMAN GOES BEFORE THE MONKEY COURT AND TRIES TO PROVE HE HAS THE RIGHT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHERE ARE THE REPUBLICANS IN ALL OF THIS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THEY ARE THE MONKEYS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; DOES ANYBODY HAVE CREDIBILITY. AS EZRA KLINE POINTS OUT. DEMOCRATS DEFLECTING, A COUPLE ASKED REAL QUESTIONS, REPUBLICANS ARE INTENT ON HIGHLIGHTING EVERYTHING THAT&#39;S WRONG WITH THIS AND NOW THEY ARE GOING AFTER SO-CALLED PRIVACY INDISCRETIONS -- NOT INDISCRETIONS BUT VIOLATIONS OF HIPAA LAWS. THIS SEEMS TO BE COOKED UP TO UNDERMINE EFFICACY AND PERMANENCE OF AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THIS IS A REAL ISSUE. THIS IS A REAL GOVERNMENT FAILURE. THIS IS THE KIND OF THING THERE SHOULD BE OVERSIGHT ON. THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO HOLD HEARINGS, WHAT WENT WRONG, WHO KNEW. I THINK THAT&#39;S PROPER. THEY ARE TRYING TO DRIVE IT INTO THE OLD STRATEGY, INDIVIDUAL MANDATES TO STOP IT. THEY DON&#39;T NEED A LAW TO DELAY INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. FIRST OF ALL WE&#39;VE GOT UNTIL MARCH 31st AS YOU REPORTED. THAT&#39;S A LOT OF TIME TO FIX WEBSITES. SECOND OF ALL, THEY CAN DELAY ON ITS OWN WITHOUT LEGISLATION. THEY CAN USE HARDSHIP EXEMPTIONS TO GO TO STATES WHERE PEOPLE DON&#39;T HAVE WORKING WEBSITES AND DELAY IT. THERE&#39;S NO NEED FOR A LAW BUT I THINK THEY WANT A LAW BECAUSE THEY WANT TO STOP THE LAW. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HEATHER, WHAT&#39;S INCREDIBLE ABOUT WATCHING HEARINGS, INCREDIBLE IS WRONG WORD, IT&#39;S DEPRESSING. THE LACK OF UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY IS HAPPENING HERE AND THE PRETENSE, SINGLE OUT MARSHALL BLACK ASKING CONVOLUTED TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THAT WILL SOMEHOW BE THE GOTCHA QUESTION FOR CGI. THEN YOU KIND OF CONTRAST THAT WITH THE WAY REPUBLICANS BEHAVED IN AND AROUND IMPLEMENTATION OF MEDICARE PART D, PEOPLE LIKE JOE BARTON, IN 2006 SAID OF MEDICARE PART D, A GEORGE W. BUSH PROGRAM. THIS IS A HUGE UNDERTAKING AND THERE ARE GOING TO BE GLITCHES. MY GOAL IS THE SAME AS YOURS, GET RID OF THE GLITCHES. THE IRONY THERE IS ALMOST TOO THICK TO SLICE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE IRONY OF SAYING WE ARE GOING TO RAISE HOLY HECK BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE ARE HAVING DELAY IN GETTING IN THROUGH THE EXCHANGES WHERE THERE ARE DOZENS OF REPUBLICAN STATES THAT DENIED HEALTH CARE AT ALL TO THE WORKING POOR. YOU DON&#39;T WANT AMERICANS TO HAVE ACCESS TO THIS AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE? WE&#39;VE SEEN THIS CREEP OVER THE LAST DECADE OF CYNICISM AND DISGUST AND TRANSPARENCY ABOUT HOW SELF-INTERESTED AND SELFISH. THESE ARE PEOPLE&#39;S LIVES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; REPEAL, I ASKED WHETHER THERE WOULD BE A REPUBLICAN ALTERNATIVE. HE SUGGESTED PAUL RYAN IN JANUARY WAS GOING TO UNVEIL THE GOP&#39;S ALTERNATIVE TO OBAMA CARE BUT HOUSE LEADERSHIP -- REPUBLICAN HOUSE LEADERSHIP HAS NO IDEA WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT. EVEN IF THEY DO HAVE SOMETHING, AS JONATHAN POINTS OUT PAUL RYAN&#39;S HEALTH CARE PLAN AND MEDICARE PLAN WOULD REQUIRE GOVERNMENT TO RUN ONLINE INSURANCE MARKETPLACES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; EXACTLY. WE HAVEN&#39;T HEARD MUCH ABOUT REPLACE IN A LONG, LONG TIME FOR THESE FOLKS. A COUPLE OF YEARS SINCE I HEARD REPLACE. THEY DROPPED DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. WORTH REMEMBERING, REPUBLICANS STELLAR TRACK RECORD IN THESE KINDS OF INVESTIGATIONS, FAST AND FURIOUS, THAT REALLY TURNED UP SOMETHING, DIDN&#39;T IT. BENGHAZI AND IRS SCANDAL WHICH DARRELL ISSA IS BANGING ON SOMETIMES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THIS IS REAL. THERE&#39;S NO QUESTION. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THEY ARE CAREFUL ABOUT SEEMING TOO WITCH HUNTY, IF YOU CAN USE THAT AS AN ADJECTIVE. THAT&#39;S THE SHIFT, REPEAL THIS THING, &quot;NEW YORK TIMES&quot; SAYS REFOCUSING EFFORTS FOR DENYING FUNDS TO INVESTIGATING IT. SO NOW WE GET TO SEE MARCIA BLACKBURN DON THEIR SLEUTHING GEAR AND THE COUNTRY IS PUT THROUGH SOMETHING WHERE THERE SHOULD BE ANSWERS GIVEN. I DOUBT WE&#39;RE GOING TO GET ANYTHING FROM THIS. DO YOU AGREE, JONATHAN? MONKEY COURT? EVERYONE IS LOSING. HE THROWS HIS HANDS UP. YES. WE&#39;RE TAKING A BREAK. REPUBLICANS APPARENTLY HAVE 40 BILLION REASONS TO CUT FOOD STAMPS BECAUSE 20 BILLION DIDN&#39;T COVER IT. WE&#39;LL DISCUSS WHETHER OR NOT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WILL GO HUNGRY NEXT WEEK WHEN SENATOR PAT LEAHY JOINS US JUST AHEAD.","media$content":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":800000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":501.568,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":360,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/58_kuGpZeQ8L?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":640,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":500000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":501.568,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":240,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/BgXtkfuTvNvd?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":420,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":501.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":0,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/37TZ9vmjJgJ2?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":0,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"media$thumbnails":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"image","plfile$duration":0.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"JPEG","plfile$height":1080,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_wag_b_131024.jpg","plfile$width":1920,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"link":"","pubDate":1382637540000,"plmedia$defaultThumbnailUrl":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_wag_b_131024.jpg","nnd$associatedPlaylist":{"href":"http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_49748425"},"nnd$brand":"MSNBC","nnd$bureau":"30RockNY","nnd$bviAssetId":"n_wag_b_131024","nnd$canonicalUrl":{"href":"http://www.msnbc.com/now-with-alex-wagner/watch/dems-show-frustration-at-obamacare-hearing-56152131985"},"nnd$distributionProfile":["MSN-CA"],"nnd$firstAiredAtUtc":1382631485000,"nnd$lastAiredAtUtc":1382631485000,"nnd$lastEditorialChangeAtUtc":1382637591000,"nnd$longTitle":"Dems show frustration at Obamacare hearing","nnd$playCount30":2392,"nnd$playCountDay":5,"nnd$playCountYear":2387,"nnd$requiresCaptioning":true,"nnd$shortDescription":"Thursday marked the first day of House hearings on Obamacare and on its federal website healthcare.gov.

PASS IMMIGRATION REFORM. IT&#39;S GOOD FOR OUR ECONOMY, IT&#39;S GOOD FOR OUR NATIONAL SECURITY, IT&#39;S GOOD FOR OUR PEOPLE AND WE SHOULD DO IT THIS YEAR. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt;&gt; DESPITE GRIDLOCK PRESIDENT OBAMA URGED MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TO WORK TOGETHER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE SOMETHING IS SMART AND FAIR AND GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY, FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE, SUPPORTED BY BUSINESS AND LABOR AND EVANGELICAL COMMUNITY AND MANY DEMOCRATS AND MANY REPUBLICANS, THAT DOES NOT MEAN IT WILL ACTUALLY GET DONE. THIS IS WASHINGTON AFTER ALL. LETS NOT WAIT. IT DOESN&#39;T GET EASIER. TO JUST PUT IT OFF. LETS DO IT NOW, LETS DON&#39;T DELAY. LETS GET IT DONE AND LETS DO IT IN A BIPARTISAN FASHION. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NO MATTER HOW LOUD THE CALL OF REFORM, THE DIN OF HEALTH CARE REMAINS AT SUCH A HIGH VOLUME HEARING ANYTHING BUT MAY BE IMPOSSIBLE. AFTER WEEKS OF GLITCHES, FAILURES, THE PRESSURE RAMPED UP YESTERDAY WHEN A HANDFUL OF DEMOCRATIC SENATORS BEGAN DRAFTING A BILL TO DELAY THE HEART OF THE ACT, INDIVIDUAL MANDATE, GIVES INDIVIDUALS TIME TO SIGN UP FOR COVERAGE BEFORE PENALTIES KICK YOU IN BUT DOES NOT COME WITHOUT POLITICAL COST. THE WHITE HOUSE IS PUSHING BACK ON DELAY. IN THEORY, INDIVIDUALS MUST HAVE STARTED THE APPLICATION PROCESS BY FEBRUARY 15th. OPEN ENROLLMENT ENDS ON MARCH 31st. IT IS NOW SYNCING DEADLINES, DEADLINE IS STILL MARCH 31st BUT PENALTIES WILL NOT OCCUR UNTIL AFTER THAT DATE. WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS TELL NBC NEWS THE DATE WAS SIMPLY A SLIDE TO THE DEADLINE AND A GLITCH WITHIN THE LAW, A DISTINCTION WITHOUT A DIFFERENCE. LAST NIGHT WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY PUSHED BACK ON CLAIMS THE WHITE HOUSE WAS DELAYING, NBC IS WRONG AGAIN, EARNEST TWEETED, INDIVIDUAL MANDATE HASN&#39;T CHANGED. DEADLINE FOR HAVING INSURANCE IS MARCH 31st. WHAT WAS TRUE THIS MORNING IS TRUE TONIGHT. JOINING ME TODAY SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT FOR &quot;DAILY BEAST.&quot; JOINING US SENIOR WHITE HOUSE REPORTER FOR &quot;POLITICO,&quot; GLEN THRESH. A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH, FOOTSIE OVER THE DEBATE. THE PRESIDENT SPOKE ABOUT IMMIGRATION REFORM. I WAS REMINDED OF TIMES PRIOR WHEN THE PRESIDENT SORT OF DID NOT SPEAK TO THE NEWS OF THE MORNING OR THAT WEEK. EARLIER THIS YEAR GAVE A SPEECH ON ACA IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NAVY YARD SHOOTING, THE MIDDLE OF THE LEAK FIASCO, EDWARD SNOWDEN, GIVING A SPEECH ON ACA. HE LIKES TO PIVOT. MY QUESTION TO YOU IS HOW SUCCESSFUL IS THIS GOING TO BE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO ANNOUNCE A MINOR NONLIFE THREATENING MEDICAL PROCEDURE HE HAS TO UNDERGO. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE REMOVAL OF A MOLE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE REMOVAL OF A MOLE WOULD BE REALLY GOOD RIGHT NOW. HE CAN&#39;T KEEP TALKING -- THIS IS PR 101. THE THING ABOUT THIS IS, THOUGH, AS FORMER SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL TOLD ME SEVERAL DAYS AGO, THIS IS NOT A COMMUNICATIONS PROBLEM, THIS IS A FIX THE PROBLEM PROBLEM. I SHOULD ALSO SAY THAT THOSE OF US WHO HAVE SPOKEN WITH WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS HAVE BEEN TOLD TIME AND TIME AGAIN THEY FELT IMMIGRATION WAS OFF THE TABLE UNTIL 2015. SO YES THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A SMART PLAY FOR THEM. THEY NEED TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT AND THIS CLEARLY CUTS THE GOP IN HALF IN THE WAY THE DEBT CEILING FIGHT DID. IN TERMS OF AN AGENDA THAT GETS THINGS DONE, I WOULDN&#39;T HOLD MY BREATH. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ARE THOSE CONVERSATIONS YOU HAD WITH WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS AFTER OR BEFORE THE SHUTDOWN? TO ME IT SEEMS THERE&#39;S A SENSE AMONG DEMOCRATS THEY HAVE INCREASED POLITICAL CAPITAL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BEFORE THE SHUT DOWN, YEAH. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; PERHAPS, AND I&#39;LL BRING OUR PANEL IN HERE, JONATHAN, PERHAPS THE PRESIDENT DOES FEEL HE CAN TRY TO BRING UP IMMIGRATION REFORM OR IT CAN BE USED TO TAKE BACK IN 2014 WHEN THE DEMOCRATS SEEM TO SMELL BLOOD IN THE WATER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S RIGHT. IN OBAMA&#39;S MIND HE&#39;S DOING REPUBLICANS A FAVOR SAYING, LOOK, HERE IS MY WAY OF HELPING YOU WITH YOUR PROBLEM WITH THE SEGMENTS OF ELECTORATE THAT HATE YOU. HELP ME WITH THE BILL. I&#39;LL HELP YOU AND YOU&#39;LL HELP ME AND GET AN ISSUE PASSED FOR HIS LEGACY. HE SAYS THIS IS A WIN WIN. I DON&#39;T THINK REPUBLICANS VIEW THAT AS AN OLIVE BRANCH. THEY JUST HATE HIM MORE THAN EVER AND DON&#39;T WANT TO DEAL WITH HIM. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S INTERESTING, HEATHER, THIS MORNING, BOEHNER&#39;S PRESS SECRETARY, THE INIMITABLE MAN WHO I HOPE IS WATCHING THE SPEAKER AGREES IT&#39;S A BROKEN IMMIGRATION DISEM AND NEED REFORM TO BOOST THE ECONOMY. HE&#39;S ALSO CLEAR THE HOUSE WILL NOT CONSIDER ANY MASSIVE OBAMA CARE-STYLE LEGISLATION THAT NO ONE UNDERSTANDS. THIS IS GOING TO BE USED AS THE BOOGIE MAN. WE CAN&#39;T DO CLIMATE CHANGE, WE CAN&#39;T DO IMMIGRATION REFORM BECAUSE LOOK HOW BAD OBAMA CARE IS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THERE&#39;S SO RIDICULOUS OF THERE&#39;S THINGS THAT CONNECT OBAMA CARE TO IMMIGRATION REFORM LIKE PEOPLE IN GOVERNMENT TRYING TO SOLVE PROBLEMS OF PEOPLE&#39;S LIVES OUT IN THE COUNTRY. PEOPLE ARE LOSING FAMILY MEMBERS, NOT BEING ABLE TO GO TO COLLEGE, NOT BEING ABLE TO WORK AT A WAGE THAT WILL FEED FAMILIES. PEOPLE ARE GOING BANKRUPT, CAN&#39;T GET PRE-EXISTING, PEOPLE ARE DYING. THANKSFULLY WE GOT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. IT&#39;S BEYOND CYNICAL FOR REPUBLICANS TO STOP THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS FROM GETTING HEALTH CARE. THAT&#39;S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; MICHAEL, THE WHITE HOUSE SEEMS TO BE PURSUING A WALK AND CHEW GUM STRATEGY, MUCH TO THE GREAT HAPPINESS OF THOSE WHO CALLED FOR SUCH A MOVE. THERE ARE GOING TO BE DAILY BRIEFINGS ON UPDATING -- UPDATES, IF YOU WILL, ON THE PROGRESS RELATING TO FIXING THESE WEBSITES, FEDERALLY RUN EXCHANGES. I&#39;M REMINDED OF THE TIME MANY MOONS AGO WHEN I WAS COVERING WHITE HOUSE DURING BP OIL SPILL AND EVERY DAY BEGAN WITH A NEW IMAGE FROM THE HORRIBLE CAMERA WHERE THE OIL KEPT LEAKING. IT WAS A TERRIBLE REMINDER OF JUST HOW BAD THINGS HAD GOTTEN. I THINK IT MIGHT BE GOOD IN THE END FOR THE WHITE HOUSE TO BE AS TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE. WHAT DO YOU THINK? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THEY ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO BE. THIS IS GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME TO FIX THIS PROBLEM. THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE FIXED THIS WEEK, NOT GOING TO BE FIXED NEXT WEEK. IN THE MEANTIME SUCCESS STORIES, KENTUCKY BEING THE MOST CONSPICUOUS AND THEY CAN ROLL OUT SUCCESS STORIES TO COUNTER BAD PRESS. THE BAD PRESS ON THE HEALTH CARE ROLLOUT IS GOING TO CONTINUE FOR A LITTLE WHILE. THEY HAVE TO TRY AND DO OTHER THINGS. IMMIGRATION IS OBVIOUS THING TO DO, IMMIGRATION DOESN&#39;T HAVE MUCH OF A CHANCE IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. THE ONLY CHANCE IT MIGHT HAVE, ALEX, IS IF THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE PUT MUSCLE INTO THEIR POSITION, PRO REFORM POSITION AND REALLY TRY TO LEAN ON REPUBLICANS, TOM DONAHUE HAS NOW SAID SINCE THE SHUTDOWN HE&#39;S GOING TO TRY TO MAKE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY MORE REASONABLE. LETS SEE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; KARL ROVE SAID MAYBE IT&#39;S NOT SUCH A GREAT IDEA TO HAVE A FRACTIOUS MINORITY RUINING THINGS FOR EVERYBODY ELSE. THAT&#39;S A MAJOR PARAPHRASE. GLEN, TO THE WHITE HOUSE&#39;S STRATEGY FOR A SECOND. EZRA KLEIN HAD AN INTERESTING INTERVIEW ON THE &quot;WASHINGTON POST&quot; WITH AN INSURANCE EXPERT, SAID HE&#39;S BRINGING THINGS IN TO SHEPHERD THIS THROUGH. SEBELIUS WOULD BE IN CHARGE BY NAME BUT DO YOU THINK THAT&#39;S ACCURATE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I&#39;VE DONE REPORTING FOR AN UPCOMING PIECE THAT GOES FURTHER IN THAT DIRECTION. SEBELIUS WAS GIVEN A FAIR AMOUNT OF LATITUDE. WE&#39;RE GOING TO FIND IN THE COMING DAYS THERE WERE CLEARLY SIGNS, WE&#39;VE SEEN SOME REPORTING ON THIS TODAY, THINGS WERE KIND OF GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. THE WHITE HOUSE HAS MORE OR LESS DISINVESTED FROM HER. INSIDE HE&#39;S THEIR SUPERSTAR. THERE IS A LOT OF OVERLAP BETWEEN THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. THREE OF THE LARGEST STATES THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF UNINSURED FOLKS, TEXAS, FLORIDA, AND CALIFORNIA ALSO HAD A VERY LARGE PERCENTAGES OF HISPANIC FOLKS. SO THERE&#39;S A LOT OF OVERLAP IN TERMS OF THEIR MESSAGING. IT&#39;S A SMART PLAY, I THINK, TO GET GOOD PRESS RIGHT NOW IN IMMIGRATION IN THOSE STATES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IN LARGE NUMBER PEOPLE THAT NEED TO SIGN UP. IN THE &quot;NEW YORK TIMES,&quot; A POINT LIBERALS SHOULD FOCUS LIKE A LASER BEAM ON OBAMA CARE. IF HEALTH CARE WORKS THIS WILL BE REMEMBERED AS AN ERA OF PROGRESSIVE PUBLIC POLL SICHLT THE PROSPECTS FOR EXTENDING THAT INTO ANOTHER PRESIDENCY AND GETTING IMMIGRATION AND CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE REST OF THE POLICY WISH LIST WILL GET A LOT, LOT BRIGHTER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; PROBABLY TRUE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; DO YOU THINK THE REVERSE IS TRUE? IF IT CONTINUES TO BE PLAGUED BY GLITCHES, HAS TO BE SHUT DOWN, SPLIT UP AS HOWARD DEAN SUGGESTED REGIONAL FEDERALLY RUN EXCHANGES BUT GOES THROUGH A MASSIVE REVAMP DOES THAT UNDERLINE THE BROADER AGENDA? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT DOESN&#39;T IF THEY MUDDLE THROUGH. I THINK THAT&#39;S WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO, MUDDLE THROUGH. I DON&#39;T THINK IT WILL TAKE WEEKS BUT MONTHS. YOU HAVE UNTIL THE END OF MARCH TO SIGN UP. THAT&#39;S A FAIR WINDOW OF TIME TO GET THIS GOING. ROSS IS RIGHT, HOW THIS BILL FARES IS GOING TO SET THE TONE FOR HOW PEOPLE LOOK AT GOVERNMENT AND HOW GOVERNMENT WORKS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S PART OF THE PROBLEM, FITS INTO THE CONSERVATIVE AGENDA WHICH IS TO UNDERMINE GOVERNMENT AND ALSO MAKE THE CASE GOVERNMENT IS COMPLETELY DYSFUNCTIONAL WE SHOULD NOT INVEST IN IT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LOOK, IT&#39;S BROKEN. BUT I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT THE WEBSITE IS WORKING. THERE&#39;S A LITTLE HYSTERIA HOW BAD IT IS. THERE&#39;S PEOPLE TELLING WONDERFUL STORIES TAKING THREE HOURS. WHEN IS THE LAST TIME YOU TRIED TO CALL YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY. IT TAKES THAT LONG TO GET TO A REAL HUMAN BEING. TAKING THREE HOURS AND AT THE END HAVING A $6,000 COUPON, THAT&#39;S $33 A MINUTE, BETTER THAN GEICO. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THIS IS ALSO PAUL RYAN PLAN. PAUL RYAN WANTED THIS FOR THE ELDER ELDER ELDERLY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IF THIS WORKS, WHY NOT EXTEND IT. THAT SEEMS LIKE A BETTER ARGUMENT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE CRUMMY PART IS WE&#39;VE NEVER SEEN IMPLEMENTATION OF ANYTHING THIS BIG BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THE TWITTER 24/7 CABLE ERA. WE WEREN&#39;T THERE WHEN THEY WERE DOING AGRICULTURE ADJUSTMENT ADMINISTRATION UNDER ROOSEVELT TWEETING EVERY SINGLE BURP AND BLIP. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; RIGHT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CLEARLY THIS IS NOAA SMALL PROBLEM AND THE BUCK STOPS WITH OBAMA, BUT THE LEVEL OF HYSTERIA I THINK GOING TO WORK IN OBAMA&#39;S FAVOR AS THESE GLITCHES GET FIGURED OUT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; RIGHT, BECAUSE THEN THE REPAIRS WILL BE REPORTED IN REALTIME, TOO. MICHAEL, HOW BIG A DEAL DO YOU THINK IT IS RED STATE DEMOCRATS ARE SORT OF NOW SAYING WE NEED TO DELAY THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. IS THAT SORT OF PAR FOR THE COURSE BECAUSE MARK PRYER IS UP FOR ELECTION AND IS EXPECTED TO BE SENSITIVE TO THIS OR IS THAT A PROBLEM FOR THE WHITE HOUSE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; MORE THE FORMER THAN LATTER. I KNOW JOE MANCHIN PRETTY WELL, FROM WEST VIRGINIA AND KNOW WEST VIRGINIA PRETTY WELL. I HAVEN&#39;T SEEN POLLS BUT I CAN GUESS OBAMA CARE&#39;S POPULARITY IS MAYBE 20%. SO YOU KNOW, MANCHIN IS VERY ADEPT AT PLAYING LOCAL POLITICS AS WE&#39;VE SEEN MANY TIMES. HE KNOW WHAT HE HAS TO DO TO PRESERVE HIS POSITION AS A DEMOCRATIC SENATOR FROM THAT INCREASINGLY REPUBLICAN STATE. SOME OF THESE OTHER SENATORS HAVE TO DO THE SAME THING AS WELL. I DON&#39;T SEE THAT GOING ANYWHERE AS LEGISLATION, NECESSARILY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; TO THE CREDIT THE WHITE HOUSE HAS SAID IT&#39;S OKAY. WE CAN HAVE UNTIL MARCH 31st. I THINK THE LEVEL OF RESPONSIVENESS, PARTICULARLY POST THE SHUTDOWN OF THIS WHITE HOUSE IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD ACTUALLY BE APPLAUDING. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THEY WERE CERTAINLY RESPONSIVE LAST NIGHT WHEN NBC NEWS SUGGESTED A SIX-WEEK DELAY. GLENN, THE VIRULENT RESPONSE THERE OR VIRULENCE OF THAT RESPONSE IS EVIDENCE OF JUST HOW POLITICALLY SENSITIVE THIS SUBJECT IS. WE DON&#39;T KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE, HOW DEEP THEY RUN, HOW MUCH OF THE BACK END NEEDS TO BE PREPARED BEFORE THE FRONT END. I&#39;M NOT A TECH EXPERT. THE WHITE HOUSE IS, UN -- DO YOU THINK THEY DELAY IT SIGNIFICANTLY? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IF THINGS HIT THE FAN, ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. THIS OPPONENTS OUT A FUNDAMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROBLEM IN THE WHITE HOUSE. THEY ARE REALLY CRISIS ORIENTED. YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE BP OIL SPILL. SOMEONE SAID TO ME, WE&#39;RE NOW IN THAT MODE. WE CAN EXPECT THE PRESIDENT TO BE FULLY TUNED IN ON THIS. THAT&#39;S WHY THE PROBLEM WILL GET SOLVED. THE QUESTION IS WHY DO THEY HAVE TO WAIT FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN FOR OBAMA TO GET ENGAGED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; DO YOU EXPECT THE PRESIDENT TO BE GOADING? DO YOU HAVE AN ANSWER GLENN THRUSH. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I DO NOT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; MORE DEEP REPORTING. MY FRIEND, I&#39;M GLAD TO SEE THE HAT IS BACK. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I NEVER KNEW. I DON&#39;T EXPECT IT BUT HAPPY TO SEE IT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I&#39;M IN MY HOME, SO I WEAR IT IN MY HOME. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; &quot;POLITICO&#39;S&quot; GLENN THRUSH, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt;&gt; AFTER THE BREAK, LET THE HEARINGS AGAIN. CONTRACTORS BEHIND HEALTH.GOV TESTIFY ON CAPITOL HILL, REPUBLICANS DO WHAT THEY DO BEST, GRILL BABY GRILL.

THAT SAME APPROACH MIGHT HAVE PREVENTED A PRESIDENT FROM ESCALATING A WAR OUT OF A REFUSAL TO BE THE FIRST PRESIDENT TO LOSE A WAR, AS LBJ ONCE FAMOUSLY PUT IT. YOU THINK MAYBE NOT AS GOOD ON CIVIL RIGHTS, BETTER ON VIETNAM. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IF YOU&#39;RE DOING THIS AT MAT HISTORY NOT AS A SCI-FI THING, WHAT YOU DO IN A SENSE IS YOU LEARN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FROM ORAL HISTORIES, FROM DOCUMENTS, FROM ASSESSMENTS, AND IN EFFECT IT&#39;S ALMOST LIKE RUNNING SIMULATIONS. YOU SAY, I PLUG THIS PERSONALITY OR CHARACTER TRAIT INTO THE CONDITIONS ON THE GROUND AND MAKE SOME JUDGMENTS. JOHN KENNEDY WAS A CAUTIOUS MAN. HE TALKED BOLDLY, NEW FRONTIER, BUT HE WASN&#39;T, NOT POLITICALLY. HE WAS MORE SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE POWER OF THE GOVERNMENT DOMESTICALLY. SO IF YOU&#39;RE LOOKING ABOUT, SAY -- HE WOULDN&#39;T, IN MY VIEW, THERE NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT SOCIETY. HE NEVER THOUGHT THAT WAY. IT WAS JOHNSON WHO DREAMED OF BEING THE SECOND FDR. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT WAS HOW HE GOT TO POLITICAL POWER, DELIVERING ELECTRICITY TO POOR PEOPLE IN TEXAS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; EXACTLY. CONTRARY TO THAT, AND THIS IS SOMETHING CONSERVATIVES WILL DISAGREE WITH, THAT HE WAS CONSERVATIVE ON FOREIGN POLICY. THAT&#39;S NOT THE JOHN KENNEDY WHO WENT TO DALLAS. HAVING LIVED THROUGH THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS, HAVING LEARNED TO BE SKEPTICAL ABOUT MILITARY ASSURANCES OF WHAT WE KNEW AND HOW, HAVING THOUGHT THE FRENCH WERE FOOLISH TO TRY TO HOLD ON TO THEIR EMPIRE, MY SENSE IS HE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY -- AND HE WAS. EVEN THOUGH HE DID PUT MILITARY TROOPS, EVEN THOUGH HIS ADMINISTRATION CLUMSILY AND HALF-ASSEDLY -- &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU SAID IT, NOT ME, BROTHER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S CABLE, IT&#39;S CABLE. SIGNED OFF ON A COUP THAT MADE UP MORE COMMITTED. ALL THE EVIDENCE I CAN FIND IS HE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY RELUCTANT. YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE HAD A SITUATION WHERE PRESIDENT KENNEDY WOULD HAVE GONE ON TELEVISION AND SAY FORTHRIGHTLY, WE CAN&#39;T WIN THIS WAR. HE WOULD HAVE KIND OF BACKED OUT, IN MY VIEW. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I WAS SAYING TO JEFF EARLIER, WHAT I THINK HE&#39;S DONE IS VERY IMPORTANT. A LOT OF HISTORIANS SHY AWAY FROM WHAT IS OFTEN CALLED COUNTERFACTUAL OR WHAT-IF HISTORY. IC I THINK THAT&#39;S A MISTAKE. IF YOU ENGAGE IN THAT THOUGHT SCENARIO, IT ALLOWS YOU TO THINK OF THE ROADS NOT TAKEN, THE MISSED OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH WE SHOULD ENGAGE IN. TOO OFTEN THE DISCUSSION, THE DEBATE IS CLOSED DOWN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT ALSO BRINGS UP -- I THINK IT ALSO MAKES US RE-EXAMINE HISTORY IN A MORE EVEN LIGHT, WHICH IS TO SAY LBJ AND HIS RECORD ON CIVIL RIGHTS, EVEN RICHARD NIXON AND SOME OF THE THINGS HE DID. THERE&#39;S A LOT OF MYTH MAKING FOR VARIOUS VALID REASONS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S FASCINATING YOU MENTION THAT. AFTER WE CELEBRATED THE 50th ANNIVERSARY OF THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON, THE REAL HIS TORY IS IN THE MONTHS AFTER THAT. THE CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS WERE INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATED WITH THE SLOW PACE OF GETTING THAT LEGISLATION THROUGH. THEY WERE PRODDING LEGISLATION THAT KENLEY HAD ALREADY SENT TOP CONGRESS. IT WASN&#39;T GOING ANYWHERE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AFTER THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF &#39;64 WAS ACTED, RICHARD RUSSELL SAID WE COULD HAVE BEATEN JOHN KENNEDY ON CIVIL RIGHTS. WE COULDN&#39;T BEAT JOHNSON. IN PART, NOT JUST BECAUSE JOHNSON WAS A MASTER OF THE SENATE, BECAUSE JOHNSON COULD USE THE MARTYR COME OF JACK KENNEDY TO SAY YOU HAVE TO DO THIS. IN FACT, THE -- BY THE END OF KENNEDY&#39;S LIFE, IT WAS CLEAR THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT WAS BEING BOTTLED UP. IN FACT, SO WAS SO MUCH OF THE LEGISLATION, THAT CRITICS LIKE WALTER LIPMAN AND JOHN McGREGOR WERE WRITING ABOUT A CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS, THAT WE COULDN&#39;T GET ANYTHING DONE. THE OTHER PART ABOUT THIS IS JOHN KENNEDY&#39;S FOCUS WAS THE WORLD. HIS ONLY BLACK ADVISER ONCE SAID TO HIM, YOU CARE MORE ABOUT GERMANY THAN ALABAMA, WHICH IS TRUE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S FASCINATING. A FASCINATING READ. DAVID, DID YOU WANT TO SAY ONE MORE THING? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU LOOK AT THE ART OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY, TOO. THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS, HE TURNED DOWN THE ADVICE OF HIS TOP MILITARY ADVISERS TO LAUNCH A NUCLEAR WAR. I THINK THAT GAVE HIM A WHOLE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE, AND WE NEVER SAW WHAT THAT REALLY WOULD HAVE YIELDED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND HE GETS TO MEET THE BEATLES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT IS WORTH IMAGINING. &quot;IF KENNEDY LIVED,&quot; JEFF GREENFIELD, THANK YOU.","media$content":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":322.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":0,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/TU4xagE63yJw?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":0,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":500000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":322.422,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":240,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/ysLkVc76iLHu?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":420,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":800000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":322.422,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":360,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/aQTF1y8W_i5q?feed=Now%20with%20Alex","plfile$width":640,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"media$thumbnails":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"image","plfile$duration":0.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"JPEG","plfile$height":1080,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_wag_d_131023.jpg","plfile$width":1920,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"link":"","pubDate":1382552280000,"plmedia$defaultThumbnailUrl":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_wag_d_131023.jpg","nnd$associatedPlaylist":{"href":"http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_49748425"},"nnd$brand":"MSNBC","nnd$bureau":"30RockNY","nnd$bviAssetId":"n_wag_d_131023","nnd$canonicalUrl":{"href":"http://www.msnbc.com/now-with-alex-wagner/watch/if-jfk-had-lived-what-would-have-happened-55903811999"},"nnd$distributionProfile":["MSN-CA"],"nnd$firstAiredAtUtc":1382547097000,"nnd$lastAiredAtUtc":1382547097000,"nnd$lastEditorialChangeAtUtc":1382639065000,"nnd$longTitle":"If JFK had lived: What would have happened?","nnd$playCount30":3480,"nnd$playCountDay":11,"nnd$playCountYear":3469,"nnd$requiresCaptioning":true,"nnd$shortDescription":"What would have happened if JFK had not been assassinated in Dallas in 1963?

A SMALL FRACTION OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY MAY HAVE SHUT DOWN THE ENTIRE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OVER A LAW PASSED THREE YEARS AGO BY BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS AND UPHELD BY THE SUPREME COURT, BUT FOR SOME THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH. MOVEMENTS IN SEVERAL STATES ARE USING A DIFFERENT TACTIC TO FIGHT WHAT THEY CALL LIBERAL GOVERNMENT OVERREACH, SECESSION. IN NORTHERN COLORADO, 11 COUNTIES WILL VOTE ON A NONBINDING BALLOT MEASURE TO FORM ANOTHER STATE. CERTAIN RESIDENTS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SOUTHERN OREGON ARE HOPING TO FIND THE GREAT STATE OF JEFFERSON. A FACEBOOK INITIATIVE TO CREATE THE STATE OF WESTERN MARYLAND HAS RECEIVED 7,000 LIKES. IN ILLINOIS, TWO LAWMAKERS HAVE INTRODUCED A LAW TO EXPEL THE STATE&#39;S LARGEST CITY AND THE REGION&#39;S ECONOMIC HUB, CHICAGO. ACCORDING TO THE U.S. CONSTITUTION, THE SECESSION MOVEMENTS WOULD NEED APPROVAL FROM THEIR STATE HOUSES AND SIGN OFF FROM CONGRESS, BUT THAT HAS NOT DIMINISHED THEIR ZEAL. AS ONE COLORADO RESIDENT TELLS &quot;THE NEW YORK TIMES,&quot; THERE&#39;S GOING TO BE A REVOLUTION OF SOME KIND, THIS IS THE PEACEFUL WAY TO GO ABOUT IT. IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT REPUBLICANS AREN&#39;T THE ONLY ONES SEEKING A SPLIT. FED UP WITH CUTS IN EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE AS WELL AS A DISCRIMINATORY STATE IMMIGRATION LAW, ARIZONA RESIDENTS IN THE TUCSON AREA TRIED IN 2011 TO FORM THEIR OWN STATE OF BAJA, ARIZONA. TO QUOTE, TELL THE REST OF THE NATION THAT NOT EVERYBODY IN ARIZONA IS CRAZY. JOINING US NOW IS THE CO-CHAIR OF START OUR STATE AND ASSISTANT LEGAL DEFENDER IN ARIZONA. PAUL, THANKS FOR JOINING US. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THANKS FOR HAVING ME. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHAT MOTIVATED YOU TO PUSH FOR SECESSION AS OPPOSED TO, SAY, YOU KNOW, MOBILIZING VOTERS TO TURN OUT AND ELECT DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES OR AT LEAST CANDIDATES THAT WERE MORE IN LINE WITH YOUR POSITIONS? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, BACK IN 2010 WHEN WE STARTED, THE BACKDROP WAS, ONE, TUCSON HAS NEVER LIKED PHOENIX AND PHOENIX OVERBARES US POLITICALLY BECAUSE OF NUMBERS. WE&#39;RE KIND OF JUST LEFT OF CENTER COMMUNITY WHILE PHOENIX IS VERY CONSERVATIVE. THE LEGISLATURE WAS SPECIFICALLY VERY CONSERVATIVE FAR TO THE RIGHT AND GETTING VERY EXTREME. THE CUTS IN EDUCATION HAVE BEEN GOING ON FOR A VERY LONG TIME. WE USED TO BE SIXTH IN THE COUNTRY PER STUDENT SPENDING. WE WERE LAST BY THE TIME WE DECIDED TO TAKE THIS ACTION. BUT THE KIND OF RACIST-TINGED, ANTI-IMMIGRATION BILLS THAT WERE COMING OUT OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE, NULLIFICATION STATUTES SAYING THE LEGISLATURE WAS GOING TO FOLLOW CERTAIN FEDERAL LAWS WAS KIND OF CRAZY TALK, AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT WE JUST WANTED TO AT LEAST DO SOMETHING AND PUSH BACK SYMBOLICALLY. WE KNEW IT WAS A LONG SHOT TO DO THIS. YOU HAVE TO GET APPROVAL BY A LEGISLATURE AND GO TO CONGRESS. BUT WE WANTED TO JUST PUSH BACK AND SAY, LOOK, ENOUGH WITH THE EXTREMIST POLITICS. YOU KNOW, START LISTENING TO THE CITIZENS OF ARIZONA, WHICH WERE MUCH MORE MODERATE THAN WHAT THE LEGISLATURE WAS DOING. BASICALLY, ALSO TO TELL THE REST OF THE NATION AND WORLD THAT WE&#39;RE NOT ALL A BUNCH OF CRAZIES IN TUCSON, ARIZONA. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK THE REST OF THE WORLD APPRECIATES THAT PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT. JOY, WE TALK ABOUT THE NULLIFICATION STRATEGY. THE QUOTE, THERE&#39;S A REVOLUTION COMING, THIS IS THE PEACEFUL WAY TO GO ABOUT IT. DIFFERENT POSITIONS HERE. THE SORT OF CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT SEEMS LEGIT. IT&#39;S SENDING A MESSAGE, OF COURSE, BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE GENUINE DESIRE TO ACTUALLY GET AWAY FROM THIS PRESIDENT AND HIS POLICIES, THE FEELING THAT GOVERNMENT IS ONEROUS AND IF NOT DOWNRIGHT DANGEROUS. WHAT DOES THIS TELL US ABOUT OUR COUNTRY? WE COME FROM A FRACTIOUS, VIOLENT HISTORY. THIS SEEMS DIFFERENT IN SOME WAY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT DOES. LIKE YOU SAID, IT&#39;S ABOUT GETTING AWAY. IT&#39;S FUNNY. THE BAD ME KIND OF WANTS TO LET THEM GO AND SAY, YOU KNOW, I&#39;D ALMOST LIKE TO SEE WHAT THIS COUNTRY WOULD BE LIKE. THERE WOULD BE OUTLAWS AGAINST CONTRACEPTION ABORTION. THERE WOULD BE THIS HUMONGOUS BIRTHRATE. THEY&#39;D HAD NO SOCIAL SERVICES, NO MEDICARE, NO PUBLIC SERVICES AT ALL. IT WOULD BE A COMPLETELY PRIVATE INTERVISE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THEY WOULDN&#39;T HAVE OBAMA CARE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NO OBAMA CARE. NO RULES AGAINST CHILD LAY BBORLABOR. IT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING EXPERIMENT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CAN I MAKE TWO QUICK POINTS? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THEY SET UP THEIR UTOPIA IN COLORADO. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THEY CAN&#39;T HAVE COLORADO. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I&#39;LL GIVE THEM A CORNER OF COLORADO. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE OTHER POINT WE SHOULD REMEMBER IS THAT IN 1969, HERE IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK, PEOPLE RAN FOR MAYOR ON THE SINGLE IDEA OF NEW YORK BECOMING ITS OWN STATE. IN FACT, STATEN ISLAND WANTED TO SECEDE FROM NEW YORK CITY. RUDY GIULIANI WOULD HAVE LOST THE MAYORAL ELECTION. MY POINT IS THESE THINGS ARE NOT THAT NEW. THEY ARE FEVERS THAT BANK -- &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BUT -- &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LET ME POINT OUT ONE THING. I DO THINK WE ARE BECOMING MORE POLARIZED AS A COUNTRY. IF YOU LOOK AT 1976, LESS THAN A QUARTER OF AMERICANS LIVED IN PLACES WHERE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS WERE LANDSLIDES. IN 2004, NEARLY HALF OF ALL VOTERS LIVE IN LANDSLIDE COUNTIES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK WE&#39;RE IN THE MIDST OF A POLITICAL CULTURAL WAR WHERE PEOPLE ARE MORE DUG IN. SOMETIMES EVEN LOCALLY DUG INTO THEIR POSITIONS. WE SEE PEOPLE NOT WANTING TO ADMIT, YOU KNOW, POLITICAL LOSSES. OKAY, OBAMA WON. YOU KNOW, THE DEMOCRATS, HE GETS FOUR YEARS, EIGHT YEARS TO DO WHAT HE WANTS. IF WE DON&#39;T LIKE IT, WE COME BACK. NO, WE&#39;RE GOING TO TAKE OUR BALL AND GET OUT OF HERE BECAUSE WE DON&#39;T THINK THIS IS LEGITIMATE. WE DON&#39;T THINK THIS IS THE REAL AMERICA. IT&#39;S ALL TIED INTO THAT. TODAY ON &quot;MOTHER JONES,&quot; WE PUT UP A STORY TOO EARLY FOR YOU TO SEE BEFORE THE SHOW, THAT A SENATE REPUBLICAN TEA PARTY CANDIDATE CHALLENGING TAD COCHRAN HAS SPOKEN TO NEO-CONFEDERATE GROUPS SUPPORT SUPPORTING SECESSION. THIS IS PART OF THE RIGHT-WING CULTURE. SECEDE, GET OUT, DELEGITIMIZE, THIS AIN&#39;T OUR AMERICA. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE&#39;VE BEEN MORE POLARIZED. THE CIVIL WAR, THE YEARS BEFORE THE CIVIL WAR. BUT THERE IS A TERRIBLE IRONY. PRESIDENT OBAMA CAME TO NATIONAL ATTENTION TALKING ABOUT RED AND BLUE AND AMERICA AND WANTING TO UNITE AND WEAVE THOSE TOGETHER. THIS COUNTRY NOW IS FURTHER APART. THOUGH, I DO THINK SOME OF THOSE MAPS OVERSTATE. I THINK ORDINARY AMERICANS GOING ABOUT THEIR LIVES ARE NOT NECESSARILY TRACKABLE ON ONE POLITICAL SPECTRUM. THEY FIND ISSUES THEY CARE ABOUT, BUT THERE HAS BEEN AN ATTEMPT, PARTICULARLY ON THE RIGHT, AND THERE&#39;S A WHITE SUPREMACIST STRAND WHICH HAS BEEN THERE A LONG TIME, A NEO-CONFEDERATE THAT WANTS TO DELEGITIMIZE THE POLITICAL, LEGAL -- WELL, THAT DOESN&#39;T ABIDE BY MAJORITY RULE. TAKE ACA. IT&#39;S UPHELD BY THE SUPREME COURT, PASSED BY BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS. IF PEOPLE DON&#39;T LIKE IT ON THIS KIND OF NEO-SECESSIONIST -- THEY WANT TO SAY, NO. BY THE WAY, RICK PERRY, REMEMBER ONE OF HIS BIG PLATFORMS WAS TO NULLIFY THE 17th AMENDMENT SO THAT A MAJORITY OF AMERICANS COULD NOT, IN THEIR STATE, VOTE FOR THE SENATE OF THEIR CHOICE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THERE&#39;S A BOOK CALLED &quot;A BIG SORT&quot; BY BILL BISHOP. WE LIVE IN LIKE-MINDED COMMUNITIES MORE AND MORE. WE DID IT BECAUSE OF LIFESTYLE, BUT IT HAS HUGE POLITICAL -- &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND PAUL, THAT&#39;S PART -- IT&#39;S AN YOU ARE RAN/RURAL DIVIDE AS MUCH AS ANYTHING ELSE. IT&#39;S POINTED OUT THE DIFFERENCE IS NO LONGER WHERE PEOPLE LIVE, IT&#39;S HOW PEOPLE LIVE. SPREAD OUT, OPEN, LOW-DENSITY, PRIVACY OR IN ROUGH AND TUMBLE POPULATIONS -- YOU CAN SEE THAT. THAT&#39;S BORN OUT IN WHO WON BIG CITIES IN THE LAST ELECTIONS. MITT ROMNEY WON FOUR BIG CITIES. THE ONLY ONES THAT ROMNEY WON WERE PHOENIX, OKLAHOMA CITY, FT. WORTH, AND SALT LAKE CITY. HOW DO YOU SEE THAT BEING BORN OUT WHERE YOU LIVE AND WITH THE BAJA, ARIZONA, MOVEMENT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S FUNNY. WHEN WE WERE DOING THIS EFFORT, THERE WAS A NUMBER OF THE RURAL COUNTIES THAT WERE MUCH MORE CONSERVATIVE THAN US THAT WANTED TO JOIN US BECAUSE THEY DON&#39;T LIKE PHOENIX EITHER. SO IT WAS KIND OF INTERESTING. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHAT&#39;S WRONG WITH PHOENIX? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S A RURAL/URBAN SPLIT A LITTLE BIT. ALEX, ONE OF THE THINGS I WANTED TO MAKE A POINT ABOUT IS WE FELT WE CONTRIBUTED TO A LITTLE BIT OF SUCCESS OF BRINGING BACK ARIZONA A LITTLE MORE MODERATE. WE GOT MORE MODERATE LEGISLATORS ELECTED, BOTH ON -- MORE DEMOCRATS BUT ALSO MORE MODERATE REPUBLICANS ELECTED IN THE LAST ELECTION. AND JANUARY BR BREWER, IF YOU NOISE ETICED, PASSED THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE THE MEDICAID EXPANSION ON OBAMA CARE. WE FEEL LIKE AT LEAST WE CONTRIBUTED BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY MADE OUR VOICES HEARD USING THIS PROCESS. IT DOESN&#39;T NECESSARILY MEAN WE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO BECOME A NEW STATE. BY THE WAY, IT&#39;S HAPPENED TWICE IN OUR HISTORY. MAINE SEPARATED FROM MASSACHUSETTS IN 1820 AND WEST VIRGINIA FROM VIRGINIA DURING THE CIVIL WAR. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, YOU&#39;RE ACTUALLY BASICALLY USING A STRATEGY THAT A LOT OF THE SORT OF TEA PARTIERS USE WHICH IS WE&#39;RE NOT HERE TO GET OUR SPECIFIC AGENDA ENACTED BUT TO MOVE THE BALL FURTHER DOWN THE FIELD PERHAPS IN OUR DIRECTION. I WILL SAY, PAUL, THAT THE NAME BAJA, ARIZONA, HAS WON YOU MANY FANS IN THIS BUILDING. EVERYBODY THAT I&#39;VE TALKED TO SAYS, THAT SOUNDS LIKE AN AWESOME PLACE TO LIVE. SO CONGRATULATIONS ON MAKING A DIFFERENCE AND ALSO COMING UP WITH A GREAT NAME FOR A POSSIBLE 51st STATE. CO-CHAIR OF START OUR STATE, PAUL, THANKS FOR YOUR TIME. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; COMING UP, A NEW BOOK ASKS THE HYPOTHETICAL, WHAT IF JOHN F. KENNEDY HAD LIVED?
