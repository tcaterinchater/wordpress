I&#39;M AL SHARPTON, AND FOR THE  NEXT HOUR WE&#39;LL BE COVERING THIS BIG NIGHT IN AMERICAN POLITICS. ACROSS THE COUNTRY TONIGHT,  VOTERS ARE GOING TO THE POLLS AS THEY HAVE BEEN DOING ALL DAY. MORE THAN 300 MAYORAL ELECTIONS  RACES ARE AT STAKE. AND MORE THAN 200 LEGISLATIVE  OFFICES. AND THERE ARE SEVERAL BIG STATE  REFERENDUMS AS WELL. BUT THE BIGGEST MATCHUPS ARE THE GOVERNORS RACES IN VIRGINIA AND  NEW JERSEY. IN VIRGINIA DEMOCRAT TERRY  McAULIFFE LEADS IN THE POLLS  AGAINST REPUBLICAN KEN  CUCCINELLI. IN NEW JERSEY, GOP GOVERNOR  CHRIS CHRISTIE IS HOPING FOR A  BIG WIN BY AVOIDING THE TEA  PARTY. EVEN EMBRACING PRESIDENT OBAMA  AND WORKING WITH A DEMOCRAT. HERE IN NEW YORK CITY, BILL de  BLASIO IS THOUGHT TO BE THE MOST PROGRESSIVE IN DECADES. BUT THE MAIN EVENT WILL BE IN  THE KEY BELLWETHER STATE OF  VIRGINIA. IT IS WHERE TEA PARTIERS LIKE  KEN CUCCINELLI BECAME A TEA  PARTY STAR WITH COMMENTS LIKE  THIS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE ULTIMATE GOAL WHICH IS TO MAKE ABORTION DISAPPEAR IN  AMERICA. HOMOSEXUAL ACTS ARE WRONG AND  SHOULD NOT BE ACCOMMODATED IN  GOVERNMENT POLICY. SOMEONE&#39;S GOING TO HAVE TO COME  FORWARD WITH NAILED DOWN  TESTIMONY THAT HE WAS BORN IN  PLACE &quot;B,&quot; WHEREVER THAT IS. YOU KNOW, THE SPECULATION&#39;S  KENYA. AND THAT DOESN&#39;T SEEM BEYOND THE REALM OF POSSIBILITY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BIRTHER JOKES AND ATTACKS ON  WOMEN AND GAYS. THAT&#39;S NOT A WINNING MESSAGE IN  THE YEAR OF 2013. CUCCINELLI ALSO LED A CHARGE TO  SHUT DOWN WOMENS HEALTH CENTERS  AND REFUSED TO SAY WHETHER HE  SUPPORTS EQUAL PAY MEASURES. AND A REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR  LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR IS JUST AS  EXTREME. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; PLANNED PARENTHOOD HAS BEEN  FAR MORE LETHAL TO BLACK LIVES  THAN THE KKK EVER WAS. AND THE DEMOCRAT PARTY AND THEIR BLACK CIVIL RIGHTS ALLIES ARE  PARTNERS IN THIS GENOCIDE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT W&#39;S WHAT&#39;S ON THE BALLOT  IN VIRGINIA. THE STATE THAT BECOMES CRITICAL  IN NATIONAL POLITICS. AND SOME BRAND NEW NBC EXIT  POLLS SHOW WHAT VOTERS THERE ARE THINKING. THE NBC NEWS EXIT POLLS ASK  VOTERS HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT THE  TEA PARTY MOVEMENT. IN VIRGINIA, 43% SAY THEY OPPOSE THE TEA PARTY. JUST 30% SAY THEY SUPPORT IT. WE&#39;RE SEEING EVEN WORSE NUMBERS  IN NEW JERSEY. 47% SAY THEY OPPOSE THE TEA  PARTY. JUST 19% SUPPORT. THAT&#39;S WHAT AMERICANS ARE SAYING TONIGHT ABOUT THE RIGHT WING OF  THE GOP. AND THAT&#39;S WHY THE RIGHT WING IS PLAYING DIRTY. HERE&#39;S A ROBOCALL THAT SOME  VIRGINIA VOTERS HAVE BEEN  HEARING OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF  DAYS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; KEN CUCCINELLI IS A DEVOUT  CATHOLIC AND FAMILY MAN WHO  SUPPORTS A CULTURE OF LIFE. TERRY McCAUL CALL LIVE SUPPORTS  ABORTION ON DEMAND AT ANY TIME  FOR ANY REASON PAID FOR BY  VIRGINIA TAXPAYERS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ABORTION ON DEMAND? IT&#39;S NOT TRUE, AND IT&#39;S A SIGN  OF JUST HOW DESPERATE AND OUT OF TOUCH THE RIGHT WING HAS BECOME. JOINING ME ARE FORMER  PENNSYLVANIA GOVERNOR ED RENDELL AND JESS McINTOSH. THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THANKS FOR HAVING ME. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; OUR PLEASURE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; JESS, HOW IMPORTANT HAS THE  ABORTION ISSUE BEEN IN THE  VIRGINIA RACE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LOOK, I THINK WOMEN&#39;S ISSUES, WOMEN VOTERS HAVE BEEN  ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL IN VIRGINIA. BECAUSE THEY HAVE A CANDIDATE  WHO IS LITERALLY THE HUMAN  EMBODIMENT OF THE REPUBLICAN WAR ON WOMEN. WE SAW IN 2012 HISTORIC GENDER  GAPS. MORE WOMEN TURNED OUT FOR  DEMOCRATS THAN EVER BEFORE IN  HISTORY. AND IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE  REJECTING A BUFFET OF TERRIBLE  POLICIES THAT ROLL BACK THE  CLOCKS ON WOMEN&#39;S RIGHTS AND  OPPORTUNITIES. AND KEN CUCCINELLI HAS ACCEPTED  EVERY ITEM ON THAT MENU. THAT&#39;S WHY WE&#39;LL SEE EVEN MORE  WOMEN TURNING OUT TODAY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; GOVERNOR RENDELL, IT&#39;S BEEN A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THE GOP, THE  GENDER GAP. IN 2012 THE PRESIDENT BESTED  MITT ROMNEY AMONG WOMEN BY 12  POINTS, 55-43. AND TODAY IN VIRGINIA THE GAP IS TWICE THAT. CUCCINELLI TRAILS BY 24 POINTS  AMONG WOMEN. WHEN WILL THEY LEARN, GOVERNOR? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S AMAZING. YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT 2012  WOULD HAVE TAUGHT THEM  SOMETHING. BUT THEY WENT AND STARTED  PASSING PERSONHOOD AMENDMENTS  AND THINGS THAT WERE REALLY  REPUGNANT TO ORDINARY WOMEN. WHAT CUCCINELLI HAS DONE IS HE&#39;S MADE THOSE ISSUES THE CENTER OF  HIS CAMPAIGN. IF YOU JUXTAPOSE HIM TO  CHRISTIE, HE&#39;S PRO-LIFE. BUT GOVERNOR CHRISTIE DOES NOT  MAKE THAT A TALKING POINT IN HIS CAMPAIGN. THERE&#39;S A BIG DIFFERENCE. THE DIFFERENCE IS ON EMPHASIS. THEY HAVEN&#39;T LEARNED THAT THIS  MAY BE A WINNING STRATEGY FOR  PRIMARIES, BUT IT IS A LOSING,  LOSING STRATEGY FOR GENERAL  ELECTIONS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE GOVERNOR SAID SOMETHING  REALLY IMPORTANT WHICH IS IF  REPUBLICANS COULD LEARN THEIR  LESSON THEY WOULD HAVE. IF REPUBLICANS HAD READ 2012, WE NEVER WOULD HAVE HAD CUCCINELLI  AS A CANDIDATE RIGHT NOW. BUT THEY WENT OUT AND PICKED THE EXACT WORST PERSON TO REPRESENT  THEM IN THE STATE OF VIRGINIA. AND WE&#39;RE SEEING IN 2014 THE  LINEUPS IN GEORGIA, THE LINEUPS  IN NORTH CAROLINA. THESE GUYS MAKE TODD AKIN LOOK  MODERATE. SO I WOULD LOVE TO THINK THAT  REPUBLICANS WERE GOING TO WAKE  UP AND START TRYING TO APPEAL TO WOMEN, BUT IT DOESN&#39;T HONESTLY  SEEM THEY&#39;VE LEARNED LESSONS AT  ALL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; JESS, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE  RECORD, I MEAN TERRIBLE RECORD  OF KEN CUCCINELLI, I AGREE WITH  YOU THAT IT PROBABLY WAS THE  WORST CANDIDATE THEY COULD COME  WITH. HE WAS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR  GOVERNOR ULTRASOUND BOB  McDONNELL. HE WITHHELD SUPPORT FROM THE  VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT. HE OPPOSED ABORTIONS EVEN IN  CASES OF RAPE AND INCEST. AND HE WROTE LEGISLATION TO  DEFUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD. YOU COULDN&#39;T HAVE GOTTEN A WORSE CANDIDATE FOR WOMEN AFTER 2012. I DON&#39;T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE  LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF THE  RESULTS, GOVERNOR. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NO, I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH  YOU. IT&#39;S ASTONISHING. IT&#39;S JUST AS ASTONISHING WHEN  THEY SAY WE NEED MORE IN THE  AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND  THEN THEY ADOPT POLICIES OR SAY  THINGS THAT ARE INEPT FOR  AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS AND  LATINO VOTERS. IT&#39;S NOT THE OUTREACH. IT&#39;S NOT THE MESSENGER. IT&#39;S THE THINGS YOU SAY AND WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN. THEY HAVEN&#39;T LEARNED ONE WIT. AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT  THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY PROBLEMS ON  THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, THEY&#39;RE  HEADED TOWARDS, I THINK, A  DISASTER IN &#39;14 AND WORSE FROM  THEIR STANDPOINT, A LOSING  TICKET IN &#39;16 BECAUSE THEY  HAVEN&#39;T LEARNED. AND THE INTERESTING THING, REV,  IS THAT THERE ARE REPUBLICAN  EXAMPLES OUT THERE, NOT JUST  CHRIS CHRISTIE. BUT THE MIDWEST GOVERNORS,  KASICH AND SNYDER. WHO DO NOT ACTIVELY GO OUT AND  WAGE WAR AGAINST WOMEN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S TRUE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THEY STAND A GOOD CHANCE OF  GETTING RE-ELECTED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, JESS, WHAT IS AN  INTERESTING FACT IS EVEN IN A  STATE WHERE REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR  CHRIS CHRISTIE IS WINNING, NEW  JERSEY VOTERS STILL HAVE AN  UNFAVORABLE OPINION OF THE GOP. 39% HAVE A FAVORABLE OPINION OF  THE GOP. 57% HAVE AN UNFAVORABLE VIEW. SO REALLY CHRISTIE&#39;S DOING WELL  BY DISTANCING HIMSELF FROM THE  PARTY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, THE THING IS CHRISTIE&#39;S GOT THE SAME -- WE KNOW HOW TO  BEAT CHRISTIE IN 2016. HE IS CUT FROM THE SAME MOLD AS  KEN CUCCINELLI. AS SOON AS WE START TALKING  ABOUT THE ACTUAL DIRECTION HE  WANTS TO TAKE THIS COUNTRY,  WOMEN AND THE ISSUES YOU  MENTIONED, THOSE DON&#39;T TURN OFF  JUST DEMOCRATIC WOMEN. INDEPENDENT WOMEN, REPUBLICAN  WOMEN. WE DO A LOT OF RESEARCH INTO  VOTERS. AND WOMEN ON NEITHER SIDE OF THE AISLE WANT TO BE DISRESPECTED. SO IF CHRIS CHRISTIE STARTS  TALKING ABOUT THE POLICIES THAT  HE BELIEVES IN AND THE AGENDA  THAT HE WANTS TO TAKE, WOMEN ARE GOING TO FLOCK TO THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE AS SOON AS THEY START  HEARING THAT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ISN&#39;T THAT THE CASE,  GOVERNOR, BECAUSE IT&#39;S A BIG WIN TONIGHT FOR CHRISTIE BUT ISN&#39;T  IT THE CASE THAT 2014, 2016 THAT PEOPLE HAVE SAID THINGS THAT  HAVE CORE VALUES THAT TRANSCEND  THEIR PARTY DIFFERENCES. AND AS YOU MENTIONED IF YOU&#39;RE  WOMEN, IF YOU&#39;RE GAY, IF YOU&#39;RE  AN IMMIGRANT, IF YOU&#39;RE  AFRICAN-AMERICAN, THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO  WITH PARTY LABELS. IT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THE POLICIES AND VALUES YOU BELIEVE  IN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; RIGHT. AND I THINK SHE MADE A TERRIFIC  POINT. I THINK CHRIS CHRISTIE IS NOT  ONLY OR HIS BASIC CORE VALUES  ARE EXTREMELY CONSERVATIVE, BUT  HE&#39;S MAKING THE SAME MISTAKE  MITT ROMNEY MADE. HE&#39;S TRYING TO GO FURTHER TO THE RIGHT. HE&#39;S CHANGED HIS POSITION ON A  COUPLE OF KEY ISSUES TO GO  FURTHER TO THE RIGHT TO APPEASE  REPUBLICAN PRIMARY VOTERS. AND THEN IF HE DOES THAT, IF HE  CONTINUES TO GO IN THAT  DIRECTION, IT&#39;S GOING TO BE  IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO GET BACK  AND DO WELL IN THE CENTER IN A  GENERAL ELECTION. SO WE&#39;RE SEEING NO ONE&#39;S  LEARNING. CHRIS CHRISTIE SAYS I&#39;M MY OWN  MAN, AND YET YOU CAN SEE HIM  CREEPING TO THE RIGHT AND  CHANGING HIS POSITION TO APPEAL  TO REPUBLICAN PRIMARY VOTERS. WELL, THAT&#39;S NOT BEING YOUR OWN  MAN AND IT WON&#39;T WASH IN A  GENERAL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHAT RACES ARE YOU  PARTICULARLY WATCHING TONIGHT,  GOVERNOR? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, INTERESTINGLY, THE ONE  THAT I&#39;M MOST INTERESTED IN IS  THE COLORADO REFERENDUM ON  EDUCATION. WHERE VOTERS ARE GOING TO BE  ASKED TO PAY MORE TAXES TO FUND  EDUCATION. AND VOTERS IN COLORADO, THE  POLLS SHOW, CARE VERY MUCH ABOUT FUNDING FOR EDUCATION, BUT  THERE&#39;S BEEN A WITHERING  CAMPAIGN ON THE OTHER SIDE. THAT&#39;S AN ISSUE THAT TALKS TO ME ABOUT THE CENTRAL QUESTION OF  WHAT TYPE OF AMERICA ARE WE  GOING TO HAVE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO BE  WATCHING TONIGHT, JESS? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; MAYORS. MAYORS. WE HAVE AMAZING DEMOCRATIC WOMEN RUNNING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. WE HAVE BETSY HODGES IN  MINNEAPOLIS. WE NEED MORE DEMOCRATIC WOMEN IN THESE EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP  SEATS. I THINK WE MIGHT GET A FEW  TONIGHT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I&#39;M GOING TO HAVE TO HOLD IT  THERE.","media$content":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":500000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":676.043,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":240,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/FXb2lXtQ9OlW?feed=PoliticsNation","plfile$width":420,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":800000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":676.043,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":360,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/VU4cJFkSP9xU?feed=PoliticsNation","plfile$width":640,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":676.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":0,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/kTRnIibZcNeP?feed=PoliticsNation","plfile$width":0,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"media$thumbnails":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"image","plfile$duration":0.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"JPEG","plfile$height":1080,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_sharp_1poll_131105.jpg","plfile$width":1920,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"link":"","pubDate":1383695100000,"plmedia$defaultThumbnailUrl":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_sharp_1poll_131105.jpg","nnd$associatedPlaylist":{"href":"http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_44263878"},"nnd$brand":"MSNBC","nnd$bureau":"30RockNY","nnd$bviAssetId":"n_sharp_1poll_131105","nnd$canonicalUrl":{"href":"http://www.msnbc.com/politicsnation/watch/is-2013-a-referendum-on-the-tea-party-61524547987"},"nnd$distributionProfile":["MSN-CA","AWE"],"nnd$firstAiredAtUtc":1383692403000,"nnd$lastAiredAtUtc":1383692403000,"nnd$lastEditorialChangeAtUtc":1383695604000,"nnd$longTitle":"Is 2013 a referendum on the Tea Party?","nnd$playCount30":167,"nnd$playCountDay":2039,"nnd$playCountYear":679,"nnd$requiresCaptioning":true,"nnd$shortDescription":"Rev.

ONE ELECTION NIGHT A YEAR AGO,  IT WAS MITT ROMNEY WHO WAS  COMING. PRESIDENT OBAMA RAN AWAY WITH  THE 2012 ELECTION. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY KNEW IT HAD TO CHANGE, AND THE REPUBLICAN  NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIR REINCE  PRIEBUS FOCUSED ON AVOIDING  EXTREME RHETORIC. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IF YOU GO AROUND AND SAY A  LOT OF BILOGICALLY STUPID THINGS AND CREATE A CARICATURE TO  BECOME REALITY, IT HURTS YOUR  ABILITY TO WIN AN ELECTION. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; OKAY, GREAT. VERY GOOD POINT. SO TO SUM IT UP, WHAT WAS THE  PROBLEM IN 2012? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; A LOT OF IDIOTIC THINGS SAID. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YEAH. A LOT OF IDIOTIC THINGS SAID. BUT WHAT&#39;S PRIEBUS SAYING NOW? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S THE CULTURE THAT THE  PRESIDENT&#39;S CULTIVATED HERE. A CULTURE OF DISHONESTY, A  CULTURE OF HATRED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IS HE KIDDING? PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS CULTIVATED A CULTURE OF HATRED? HE WAS BLAMING THE PRESIDENT  BECAUSE TWO DEMOCRATS COMPARED  TEA PARTIERS TO MEMBERS OF THE  KU KLUX KLAN B. LET&#39;S BE CLEAR, THOSE  COMPARISONS ARE INAPPROPRIATE. BUT TO ACCUSE PRESIDENT OBAMA OF CULTIVATING A CULTURE OF HATRED  WHEN HE&#39;S FACED COMPLETE AND  TOTAL OBSTRUCTION FROM THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY SINCE HIS FIRST DAY IN OFFICE. THOSE ON THE RIGHT REGULARLY  ACCUSE HIM OF BEING A KENYAN  BORN SOCIALIST DICTATOR. LET&#39;S LOOK AT THE CULTURE IN THE GOP. VIRGINIA&#39;S REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE  OPPOSES ABORTION EVEN IN THE  CASE OF RAPE AND INCEST. HE ONCE SAID GAY PEOPLE ARE  DESTROYING THEIR SOULS. THEN THERE&#39;S DEAN YOUNG, A  CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE IN  ALABAMA. HE THINKS PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS  BORN IN KENYA. AND ONCE SAID THAT GAYS SHOULD  LEAVE ALABAMA AND, QUOTE, GO  BACK TO CALIFORNIA OR VERMONT OR WHEREVER THEY CAME FROM. WHAT ABOUT TED CRUZ WHO ONCE  CALLED PRESIDENT OBAMA THE MOST  RADICAL PRESIDENT EVER? HE GETS HIS POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY FROM HIS FATHER, RAFAEL. WHO RECENTLY -- WHO WAS RECENTLY CAUGHT ON CAMERA SAYING THIS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHEN YOU HEAR ALL THESE  THINGS ABOUT HOMOSEXUAL  MARRIAGE, THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HOMOSEXUAL RIGHTS. DID YOU KNOW THAT? THE WHOLE OBJECTIVE IS THE  DESTRUCTION OF THE TRADITIONAL  FAMILY. HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH  HOMOSEXUALS. THEY COULD CARE LESS ABOUT  HOMOSEXUALS. THEY WANT TO DESTROY THE FAMILY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IF PRIEBUS IS WORRIED ABOUT  THE CULTURE OF HATRED, HE BETTER TAKE A LONG, HARD LOOK AT HIS  OWN PARTY. JOINING ME NOW ARE GOLDIE TAYLOR AND NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON. THEY SAY THE DEMOCRATS HAVE A  CULTURE OF HATRED. IS HE JUST FIRING UP THE  REPUBLICAN BASE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT&#39;S RIGHT. YOU SAW MITT ROMNEY. WHEN HE RAN, THIS WAS PART OF  HIS SORT OF ARGUMENT AS WELL ON  A TALKING POINT HE HAD BEING  THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS ONE OF  THE MOST DIVISIVE PRESIDENTS  EVEN. MARCO RUBIO SAID THE SAME THING. NOBODY EVER BELIEVED THAT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY PROJECT, THE AUTOPSY OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THAT  REINCE PRIEBUS RELEASED AFTER  THE CAMPAIGN, IT SHOWED THAT  PEOPLE WHO WERE POLLED THOUGHT  IT WAS REPUBLICANS WHO WERE TOO  DIVISIVE. SO YOU HAD THIS REBRANDING WHICH IN SOME WAYS HAS HAPPENED I  THINK FOR A SEGMENT OF THE  PARTY. FOR ANOTHER SEGMENT OF THE  PARTY, THEY VERY MUCH REJECTED  THAT. IT MIGHT BE THE CRUZ WING. FOR FOLKS LIKE DEAN YOUNG, HE&#39;S  VERY MUCH A DIFFERENT SORT OF  STRAIN OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. I THINK THE QUESTION NOW IS  WHERE IS THAT CEILING FOR THE  STRAIN OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. WHERE -- IT&#39;S SORT OF THE TEA  PARTY IN SOME WAYS, BUT I THINK  WE&#39;VE SEEN IT&#39;S MAYBE RELEGATED  TO THE SOUTH. PROBABLY RELEGATED TO THE HOUSE  OF REPRESENTATIVES NOT CLEAR IF  THIS GUY IS EVEN GOING TO GET  OUT OF HIS PRIMARY FIGHT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, GOLDIE, WE&#39;VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT HOW REPUBLICANS ARE  REBRANDING THEMSELVES THIS YEAR. BUT HERE&#39;S SOMETHING ELSE THAT  PRIEBUS SAID LAST NIGHT. LISTEN TO THIS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY  THAT HAS A SHAMEFUL HISTORY. IT&#39;S NOT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. I THINK IT&#39;S ABOUT TIME THAT WE  ALSO AS REPUBLICANS START  RECAPTURING THE REAL HISTORY OF  THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND NOT LET THESE GUYS REWRITE THE HISTORY  OF EQUALITY, FREEDOM, AND  OPPORTUNITY WHICH IS WHAT THIS  PARTY IS ALL ABOUT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WAS THE  PARTY OF EQUALITY. BUT WE&#39;RE NOT IN THE 1950s  ANYMORE. I MEAN, IS THIS THE BEST THEY  CAN DO? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I REALLY DO THINK THAT IT IS  THE BEST THAT THEY COULD DO. REINCE PRIEBUS PUT TOGETHER WHAT WE CALLED AN AUTOPSY. I THINK WHAT THIS PARTY NEEDS IS AN INQUEST. THEY NEED TO LOOK AT THE BODY. OBVIOUSLY THEY GOT IT WRONG ON  THIS SO-CALLED REBRANDING  EFFORT. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS  REPUBLICANS DID FOR A VERY LONG  TIME IN THIS COUNTRY REPRESENT  THE PARTY OF EQUAL PROTECTION. THEN WE HAD THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT HAPPEN. AND SO NOW TODAY YOU&#39;VE GOT A  REPUBLICAN PARTY BUILT OUT OF  THE OLD DIXIE-CRATS. CERTAINLY WOULDN&#39;T WANT BLACKS  OR LBGTs LIVING IN THEIR  COMMUNITY. SO JUST TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS  PARTY IN THE VERY SHRINKING TENT IT SEEMS TO BE EMBRACING REALLY  DEFIES WHAT WE NEED IN THIS  COUNTRY WHICH IS A STRONG  TWO-PARTY SYSTEM. WITHOUT THAT WE DON&#39;T GET THE  BEST SOLUTIONS. WE DON&#39;T GET THE BEST GOVERNING. WHAT WE GET IS THIS GRIDLOCK  WE&#39;RE SEEING TODAY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NIA-MALIKA, IF WE&#39;RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT A CULTURE OF HATRED,  LET&#39;S ADDRESS SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ELECTED REPUBLICANS HAVE  SAID ABOUT THE PRESIDENT. TAKE A LISTEN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA IS  THE MOST RADICAL PRESIDENT WE&#39;VE EVER SEEN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I DON&#39;T KNOW WHETHER BARACK  OBAMA WAS BORN IN THE UNITED  STATES OR NOT. I DON&#39;T KNOW. BUT I DO KNOW THIS, THAT IN HIS  HEART, HE&#39;S NOT AN AMERICAN. HE&#39;S JUST NOT AN AMERICAN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I&#39;M AFRAID THAT PRESIDENT  OBAMA MAY HAVE THIS KING COMPLEX SORT OF DEVELOPING. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE GENERAL CONSENSUS IS THAT HE HAS PRODUCED A BIRTH  CERTIFICATE. THE QUESTION IS IS IT  LEGITIMATE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOW, ASIDE FROM THIS KIND OF  UGLY HATE-FILLED KIND OF  RHETORIC THAT NO ONE IS REALLY  DENOUNCING IN THE REPUBLICAN  LEADERSHIP, I REALLY ALSO WANT  YOU TO ADDRESS THE SPLIT IN THE  PARTY. BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE SOME ARE  SO FIXATED ON PRESIDENT OBAMA,  THEY WILL SAY AND DO THE MOST  OUTRAGEOUS THINGS NO MATTER  WHAT. AND IT HAS BECOME POLITICALLY AN ALBATROSS OF THE PARTY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT LOOKS LIKE CUCCINELLI IS  GOING TO LOSE A RACE THAT  REPUBLICANS COULD HAVE WON IF  THEY HAD NOMINATED A MORE  MODERATE PERSON. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE PEOPLE LIKE KASICH  WHO IS THE GOVERNOR OF OHIO  TALKING ABOUT THE PARTY IN A  DIFFERENT WAY. THEY ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT  HOW TO RELATE TO NORMAL PEOPLE  ON THE GROUND. AND IT&#39;S WORKING VERY MUCH --  VERY WELL FOR SOMEBODY LIKE  CHRIS CHRISTIE WHO HAS THIS  COALITION OF BLACK PEOPLE, OF  LATINOS, OF WOMEN, OF DEMOCRATS. AND HE IS GOING TO ROMP IN THIS  RACE IN NEW JERSEY. SO THAT PROBABLY LOOKS MORE LIKE WHERE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WILL  BE NATIONALLY IN 2016. AND WE&#39;VE SEEN THAT BEFORE THAT  WHEN REPUBLICANS RUN NATIONALLY, THIGH TRY TO BE A LITTLE BIT  MORE MODERATE, KINDER, GENTLER,  THAT WHOLE THING BUSH RAN ON IN  2000. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU LOOK AT  IT, IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF THIS  RHETORIC COMES DIRECTLY FROM  RIGHT WING TALKERS. AND THAT&#39;S WHAT WE HEAR FROM  THEM. LISTEN TO THIS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BARACK OBAMA IS TRYING TO  DISMANTLE BRICK BY BRICK THE  AMERICAN DREAM. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LAST NIGHT AMERICA WATCHED AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED  STATES ACTUALLY ARGUED SOMETHING I BELIEVE IS TREASON. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU ARE DESTROYING MY  CHILDREN&#39;S FUTURE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE AS A  PRESIDENT, A RADICAL IDEOLOGUE,  RUTHLESS POLITICIAN WHO DESPISES THE COUNTRY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BARACK OBAMA IS A SOCIALIST. HE BELIEVES IN SOCIALISM IN  REDISTRIBUTING WEALTH, IN  CONFISCATING HARD-EARNED  DOLLARS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOW, IF IN FACT THEY LOSE  VIRGINIA, IF IN FACT A MODERATE  GOVERNOR WHO EMBRACED THE  PRESIDENT WINS IN NEW JERSEY, IF THEY TAKE THESE BIG LOSSES, WILL THEY START DROPPING SOME OF THE  RHETORIC AND START ECHOING WHAT  A LOT OF THE TALKERS ARE SAYING? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IN A WORD, NO. THE ESTABLISHMENT ISN&#39;T IN  CHARGE ANYMORE. THERE USED TO BE A STRONG  NATIONAL GOP CHAIRMAN WHO WOULD  CALL THE PARTIES IN AND SAY THIS IS HOW IT&#39;S GOING TO GO. AND THE POWER HAS SHIFTED.

VOTERS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY  STILL HEADING TO THE POLLS AT  THIS HOUR. THESE ARE LIVE PICTURES FROM THE ELECTION HEADQUARTERS OF TEA  PARTY REPUBLICAN KEN CUCCINELLI, THE GOP GOVERNORS CANDIDATE IN  VIRGINIA. LAST NIGHT HE TROTTED OUT FORMER CONGRESSMAN RON PAUL AT HIS  FINAL RALLY TO TRY TO DRUM UP  TEA PARTY SUPPORT. AND PAUL&#39;S RALLYING CRY FOR  ELECTION NIGHT 2013 WAS A  TALKING POINT FROM THE 1800s. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I&#39;VE BEEN WORKING ON THE  ASSUMPTION THAT NULLIFICATION IS GOING TO COME. IT&#39;S GOING TO BE A DE FACTO  NULLIFICATION IF IT&#39;S NOT  LEGALIZED. BECAUSE PRETTY SOON THINGS ARE  GOING TO GET SO BAD THAT WE&#39;RE  JUST GOING TO IGNORE THE FEDS  AND RUN OUR OWN LIVES AND OUR  OWN STATES.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NULLIFICATION IS GOING TO  COME. THE CLOSING ARGUMENT AT  CUCCINELLI&#39;S FINAL RALLY WAS A  PROMISE TO IGNORE FEDERAL LAW  AND TO EMBRACE NULLIFICATION, A  CONCEPT ONCE USED TO DEFEND  SLAVERY. IT&#39;S AN EXTRAORDINARY POSITION  TO TAKE, BUT IT&#39;S SPREADING IN  THE GOP. TODAY WE LEARN THE REPUBLICAN  STATE SENATORS IN SOUTH CAROLINA ARE GOING TO HOLD PUBLIC  MEETINGS ON THEIR NEW PLAN TO  NULLITY OBAMA CARE IN THE STATE. AND IN MISSOURI, REPUBLICANS ARE INTRODUCING A NEW MEASURE TO  NULLIFY FEDERAL GUN LAWS. SO THE RIGHT WING&#39;S BIG NEW IDEA IS TO EMBRACE ONE OF THE OLDEST  AND UGLIEST IDEAS IN OUR  POLITICAL HISTORY. NULLIFICATION. IT DATES BACK TO THE 1820s. SOUTH CAROLINA POLITICIAN JOHN  CALHOUN GAME UP WITH  NULLIFICATION AS A WAY TO LET  SLAVE-OWNING STATES IGNORE  POTENTIAL ANTI-SLAVERY LAWS FROM WASHINGTON. IT WAS A TERRIBLE IDEA THEN, AND IT&#39;S A TERRIBLE IDEA NOW. CRITICS HAVE SAID THE GOP IS  STUCK IN THE &#39;50s, AND THEY&#39;RE  RIGHT. THE 1850s. JOINING ME NOW ARE MICHAEL ERIC  DYSON AND DANA MILBANK. THANKS FOR COMING ON THE SHOW. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HI, REVEREND. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; MICHAEL, NULLIFICATION  SURFACED AT THE FINAL RALLY FOR  A REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE LAST  NIGHT. WHAT&#39;S YOUR THOUGHT ON THIS? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE&#39;VE BEEN CELEBRATING THE  50th ANNIVERSARY OF THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON AND THAT SPEECH THAT  MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. MADE. REMEMBER HE SAID ABOUT THOSE  SOUTHERN POLITICIANS WHOSE LIPS  WERE DRIPPING WITH THE WORDS OF  INTERPOSITION AND NULLIFICATION, THIS IS WHAT HE WAS REFERRING  TO. INTERPOSITION IS CLOSE LLY ALLIED  TO NULLIFICATION. THE IDEA STATES HAVE THE RIGHT  TO PUSH BACK ON FEDERAL LAW. AND NULLIFICATION IS NOT ONLY TO PUSH BACK ON IT, BUT TO REALLY  REFUSE TO IMPLEMENT IT ON THE  LOCAL LEVEL. SO HERE WE HAVE THE HARKENING  BACK AS YOU GIVE THE HISTORY  LESSON TO THOSE WHO ARE UNAWARE  OF THE USES OF THESE PRINCIPLES  TO MAKE UNCONSTITUTIONAL ANY  ATTEMPT OF THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT TO IMPOSE JUSTICE ON  LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES AND TO HAVE FEDERAL LAW RECOGNIZE AS IT  JUSTLY DESERVES TO BE. WHAT HAPPENS HERE IS CUCCINELLI  AND RAND ARE MAKING A LAST DITCH EFFORT TO SAY THAT THE TEA PARTY REALLY IS STUCK IN THE 1850s AND REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE OBAMA  CARE, AND THEY&#39;LL DO ANYTHING TO SUBVERT THE PRINCIPLE OF THE  APPLICATION OF THIS LAW NO  MATTER WHAT IT TAKES. EVEN IF IT&#39;S HARKENING BACK TO  VERY TROUBLING AND I WOULD ARGUE RACIST BELIEFS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; DANA, WHEN YOU LOOK AT A  SOUTH CAROLINA STATE SENATOR  SAYING THAT STATE NULLIFICATION  LAWS MAY BE NECESSARY, AND I&#39;M  QUOTING HIM. HE SAYS THWARTS IMPLEMENTATION  OF THIS SOCIALIST INSURANCE  CHE SCHEME IN OUR STATE. SO YOU THINK IF YOU DON&#39;T LIKE A FEDERAL LAW, YOU IGNORE IT. WHAT ARE THE POLITICS OF THIS  THOUGH? IS THIS SO EXTREME IT WILL FORCE MODERATES, INDEPENDENTS, AND  SOME REPUBLICANS TO LEAVE  BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY  DISAGREE WITH OBAMA CAY OR SOME  OTHER FEDERAL LAW? THIS IS TOO EXTREME TO DEAL WITH NULLIFYING FEDERAL LAW OR  INTERPOSING STATE LAW AS DR.  DYSON REFERRED TO DR. KING&#39;S  SPEECH? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, AS A PRACTICAL MATTER,  THE IDEA OF NULLIFICATION GOING  ANYWHERE IS PRETTY MUCH NIL. I THINK THIS IS REALLY ABOUT THE NUT-IFICATION OF THE REPUBLICAN  PARTY THAT THEY&#39;RE EVEN TALKING  ABOUT THIS SORT OF THING. LET&#39;S FACE IT, NULLIFICATION IS  REALLY JUST A PRECURSOR OF  SECESSION WHICH WE&#39;VE ALSO HEARD SOME IN THE PARTY TALKING ABOUT. MAYBE WE SHOULD MAKE THIS EASIER FOR THEM AND JUST SAY WHY DON&#39;T  YOU GUYS JUST GO AHEAD AND YOU  CAN FORM YOUR LITTLE COUNTRY  WITHOUT OBAMA CARE DOWN THERE IN THE DEEP SOUTH, AND THE BLUE  STATES WHO ARE IMPLEMENTING  OBAMA CARE ARE ACTUALLY THE ONES WHO PUT MORE IN TAXES INTO THE  COUNTRY IN THE FIRST PLACE THAN  THEY TAKE OUT. IT WILL BE A MUCH WEALTHIER  OPERATION. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YEAH, DR. DYSON, I SEE WHAT  DANA&#39;S TALKING ABOUT  NUT-IFICATION. IT&#39;S NOT JUST SOUTH CAROLINA. 11 STATES HAVE ENACTED  NULLIFICATION LAWS. 11 CONSERVATIVE COUNTIES IN  COLORADO ARE VOTING ON EXACTLY  THAT TODAY. THEY WANT TO CREATE A 51st  STATE. AND A LOT OF RIGHT WING MEDIA  PUNDITS HAVE BEEN PUSHING THE  SECESSION IDEA SINCE PRESIDENT  OBAMA FIRST WAS ELECTED. LISTEN TO THIS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I&#39;M NOT FOR SECESSION, BUT I  UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE MIGHT BE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IN THE END IF YOU&#39;RE GOING TO JAM ALL THIS STUFF DOWN OUR  THROATS, THEN MAYBE IT WOULD BE  ABOUT SECESSION. SOME PEOPLE WOULD PROBABLY SAY,  YEAH, I THINK MAYBE IT&#39;S TIME TO GET OUT OF THIS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THIS IS A REASONABLE WOMAN,  SHE&#39;S TALKING ABOUT SECESSION. CIVIL WAR. SHE&#39;S NOT ALONE, FOLKS. THIS IS NOT THE RANTINGS OF  EXTREME KOOKISM ANYMORE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; FOR TWO YEARS THE TEA PARTY  HAS DOMINATED AND RAN THE PARTY  AND HAS BEEN THE BIG GUYS OF THE GOP. BUT TONIGHT THEY MAY LOSE, THEY  MAY GET PUNCHED IN THE MOUTH IN  VIRGINIA TONIGHT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, WE HOPE SO. THIS DISCOURSE OF SECESSIONISM  AGAIN IS RELATED ULTIMATELY TO  THE CIVIL WAR WHICH IS ALSO  RELATED TO THE FACT THAT THIS  NATION WENT THROUGH ITS  BLOODIEST BATTLE OVER THE FUTURE OF ITS NATION AND THE DESTINY OF THIS GREAT NATION WHICH WAS  ABOUT WOULD WE ALLOW PEOPLE TO  BE ENCHAINED AND ENTOMBED IN  SLAVERY OR TO RISE FREE AND BE  ABLE TO MAXIMIZE THEIR POTENTIAL AS AMERICAN CITIZENS. SO HERE THESE SECESSIONISTS  AGAIN ARE SO WILLING TO JUST GUT THE HEART OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY  AND TO RE-READ THE CONSTITUTION  THROUGH THE NARROW LENS OF THEIR BIGOTRY THAT THEY REFUSE TO  ACKNOWLEDGE AS BROTHER DANA  SAID, THAT THIS IS NUTTY. IT&#39;S NOT GOING TO WORK, BUT THE  PROBLEM IS IT&#39;S SUCH A VICIOUS,  VENOMOUS ASSAULT UPON PRESIDENT  OBAMA AND THOSE WHO LOOK LIKE  HIM THAT I FEAR THAT THIS KIND  OF DIVISIVE RET RECK ONLY  PORTRAYS THE FEELING LIKE THE  FEELS THEY&#39;RE PROMOTING HERE  DOES NO GOOD AND ONLY DOES HARM  TO OUR NATION. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE&#39;RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEAVE  IT THERE. WE&#39;RE OUT OF TIME.

AND ON ELECTION NIGHT, WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS  AFTER THE ELECTION. WHAT CAN WE DO TO BRING ABOUT  CHANGE TO MILLIONS TRAPPED IN  THIS SYSTEM? ACTOR, AUTHOR, AND HUMANITARIAN  HILL HOPPER IS LOOKING TO DO  SOMETHING ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW HIM FROM HIS ROLL ON  THE HIT TV DRAMA &quot;CSI: NEW YORK&quot; AND THE CIA BUREAU CHIEF ON THE  USA NETWORK SPY DRAMA &quot;COVERT  AFFAIRS.&quot; BUT HIS LATEST ROLE IS AS AUTHOR OF &quot;LETTERS TO AN INCOURSE RATED BROTHER.&quot; HE OFFERS ENCOURAGEMENT AND HOPE FOR INMATES AND THEIR LOVED  ONES. JOINING ME NOW IS ACTOR,  HUMANITARIAN, AND AUTHOR HILL  HOPPER. THANKS FOR COMING ON THE SHOW  TONIGHT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THANKS FOR HAVING ME, REV. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, THIS IS A VERY,  VERY PROVOCATIVE SUBJECT BUT  IMPORTANT. AND AMONG THE MANY THINGS,  YOU&#39;RE AN AWARD-WINNING ACTOR. WHAT MADE YOU WANT TO WRITE  ABOUT THIS? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I DIDN&#39;T EXPECT TO DIVE INTO  THIS ISSUE, TO BE HONEST. WHAT STARTED TO HAPPEN IS IT WON THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AWARD FOR BEST BOOK FOR YOUNG  ADULTS. AND OFFICER WHO IS DEAL WITH  JUVENILE JUSTICE AND JUDGES  STARTED ASSIGNING THE BOOK TO  YOUNG MEN WHO WERE BEING  INCARCERATED. AND THEY HAD TO WRITE A BOOK  REPORT. AND WARDENS WOULD START SENDING  ME THESE BOOK REPORTS. I WAS LIKE WHY AM I GETTING BOOK REPORTS FROM PRISONS? I&#39;D CONTINUE TO GET MORE  LETTERS. AS I GOT MORE LETTERS, THEY WERE INCREASINGLY MOVING. YOU KNOW WHAT? I GOT TO DIVE INTO THIS ISSUE  AND START SEEING WHAT&#39;S GOING  ON. THEN AS I STARTED TO UNCOVER  MORE AND MORE DATA, YOU KNOW,  YOU START TO REALIZE THAT IN OUR COUNTRY WE LOCK UP 6 TO 10 TIMES MORE PEOPLE THAN ANY OTHER  INDUSTRIALIZED NATION IN THE  WORLD. FOR THE PAST 30 YEARS WE HAD  300,000 INCARCERATED  INDIVIDUALS. IT&#39;S BALLOONED TO 2.4 MILLION. MANY ON PROBATION WHO HAVE LOST  VOTING RIGHTS. THIS IS A HYPERINCARCERATION  CRISIS IN OUR COUNTRY. I WANTED TO WRITE A BOOK TO  SHINE A LIGHT ON THAT AND BRING  SOME HUMANITY AND SENSE TO THIS  ISSUE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE BOOK IS REALLY PERSONAL. BECAUSE YOU BEGIN THE BOOK WITH  A LETTER YOU RECEIVED FROM A  YOUNG MAN BEHIND BARS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND IT SAYS, QUOTE, MY NAME  IS BRIAN AND I&#39;M 16 YEARS OLD. MANY YOUNG PEOPLE DON&#39;T HAVE A  ROLE MODEL. I DIDN&#39;T HAVE ONE. THAT&#39;S WHY I&#39;M IN JAIL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; EXACTLY. WHEN I GOT THAT LETTER, IT&#39;S THE FIRST LETTER THAT APPEARS IN THE BOOK. TEARS CAME TO MY EYES. BECAUSE THIS YOUNG MAN, HE&#39;S IN  PRISON, BUT HE&#39;S SO VULNERABLE. THEN WHAT YOU DON&#39;T READ IS IN  THE LETTER HE SAYS, YOU KNOW,  I&#39;M NOT SURE IF YOU&#39;RE EVER  GOING TO GET THIS LETTER BECAUSE IT&#39;S SENT TO THE PUBLISHING  COMPANY. BUT IF YOU DO SEE IT, PLEASE  WRITE ME BACK. PLEASE. AND THERE&#39;S SO MANY WHETHER THEY BE YOUNG PEOPLE OR ADULTS WHO  ARE INCARCERATED AND FORGOTTEN. AND THEN WE START ADDING THE  STATISTICS. THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS TO TALK ABOUT AS A PROBLEM. WE NEED TO BRING SOME SOLUTIONS  TO BEAR. AND WHAT&#39;S INTERESTING --  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND ROLE MODELS SHOULDN&#39;T BE  UNDERESTIMATED. I WRITE ABOUT IT IN &quot;REJECTED  STONE&quot; THAT ROLE MODELS ARE  IMPORTANT. BUT AN ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE ONE  OF THE THINGS YOU AND I TALK  ABOUT WHEN WE HAVE BEEN TOGETHER IS YOU KNOW THE PRESIDENT VERY  WELL. BOTH OF Y&#39;ALL WENT TO HARVARD  TOGETHER. AND A LOT OF IT IS YOUR  ENVIRONMENT HELPS YOU TO HAVE  PEOPLE THAT ASPIRE LIKE YOU DO  OR NOT ASPIRE LIKE YOU DO OR ARE LOST LIKE YOU MAY BE. AND PEOPLE DON&#39;T PUT THAT INTO  THE CONVERSATION. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NO, NO, NO, THEY DON&#39;T. AND THEY ALSO DON&#39;T PUT IN THE  CONVERSATION, WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THE PEOPLE ONCE YOU PUT  THEM THERE. ARE YOU ACTUALLY, FOR INSTANCE,  WITH PRIVATIZATION OF PRISONS,  WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT INSENT INSENTIVIZES PEOPLE TO COME BACK TO PRISON BAP BECAUSE THE MODE  IS FILLING THE BEDS. ONE MAN I INTERVIEWED HIS  CORRECTION OFFICER WOULD TELL  HIM EVERY DAY THAT HE&#39;S HAPPY  HE&#39;S HERE BECAUSE IT GIVES HIM  JOB SECURITY. THE DAY HE WAS GETTING OUT THE  CORRECTION OFFICER SAID I&#39;M SURE YOU&#39;LL BE BACK BECAUSE I NEED  THAT JOB. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WOW. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SO I&#39;M NOT SAYING EVERY C.O.  IS LIKE THAT, BUT I AM SAYING  THAT WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT&#39;S SET UP TO CREATE RECIDIVISM, TO  CREATE INCARCERATION FOR URBAN  POOR. UNLESS WE START TO LOOK AT THIS, WE HAVE BERNARD CARROT TALKING  ABOUT RECENTLY WHEN HE WENT TO  PRISON HE FOUND OUT THE SYSTEM  WAS BROKEN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND YOU LOSE VOTING RIGHTS. I HAVE A BROTHER THAT IS  PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS, WORKS ON  IT ALL THE TIME. RESTORING VOTING RIGHTS FOR  EX-CONS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ONLY TWO STATES WHERE  EX-FELONS CAN VOTE. AND WITHOUT QUESTION AS CLOSE AS MANY RACES ARE, IF YOU HAD THE  REENSTATEMENT OF VOTING RIGHTS  FOR EX-FELONS WE WOULD SEE  DIFFERENT RESULTS. THERE ARE CERTAIN PEOPLE IN  POWER THAT DON&#39;T WANT THAT. AND VOTING IS A FUNDAMENTAL  AMERICAN RIGHT. I MEAN, THAT&#39;S THE DEMOCRATIC  IDEAL. AND IF YOU&#39;RE CAUGHT DOING  SOMETHING BUT FOR THE GRACE OF  GOD THERE GO I. WE&#39;VE ALL MADE MISTAKES. AND IT SHOULD NOT HAVE TO FOLLOW YOU FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE IN THAT WAY. YOU SERVED YOUR TIME. YOU DID WHAT YOU DID. YOU PAID YOUR PENALTY. NOW, LET THEM GET OFF. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO FOLLOW THE LAW,  BUT YOU CAN&#39;T VOTE FOR THOSE WHO MAKE THE LAWS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; EXACTLY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HILL HARPER, THANKS FOR  COMING ON THE SHOW. THE BOOK AGAIN IS &quot;LETTERS TO AN INCARCERATED BROTHER.&quot; A STUNNING ADMISSION IS AHEAD  FROM A BIG CITY MAYOR.

REPUBLICANS KEEP RUNNING TO THE  RIGHT AND THEY KEEP LOSING THE  FIGHT. EXACTLY ONE YEAR AGO TODAY JUST  TWO DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION,  MITT ROMNEY WAS IN THE GREAT  STATE OF VIRGINIA TELLING VOTERS HE WAS GOING TO WIN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THANKS SO MUCH, YOU GUYS. VIRGINIA IS THE BEST. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; VIRGINIA IS THE BEST. AND IT&#39;S ALSO THE STATE BARACK  OBAMA WON. ONE YEAR LATER AFTER A GOP  AUTOPSY AND A VOW TO REBRAND,  THEY HAVEN&#39;T LEARNED ANYTHING. ANY MOMENT DOZENS OF SENATE  REPUBLICANS ARE EXPECTED TO VOTE AGAINST A GAY RIGHTS LAW THAT  WOULD BAN DISCRIMINATION AGAINST GAY AND LESBIAN EMPLOYEES IN THE WORKPLACE. THAT&#39;S 39 REPUBLICANS WHO DIDN&#39;T GET THE MEMO. WHY? BECAUSE THEY HAVEN&#39;T LEARNED  ANYTHING. WHAT ABOUT WOMEN&#39;S RIGHTS? REPUBLICAN SENATOR LINDSEY  GRAHAM IS NOW LAUNCHING A NEW  FIGHT AGAINST A WOMAN&#39;S RIGHT TO CHOOSE. CALLING FOR A 20-WEEK ABORTION  BAN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I&#39;VE BEEN A PRO-LIFE MEMBER  OF CONGRESS SINCE DAY ONE. I&#39;M PROUD TO LEAD THIS CHARGE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; TODD AKIN WAS ONCE PROUD TO  LEAD THIS CHARGE. HOW&#39;D THAT WORK OUT? AGAIN, THEY HAVEN&#39;T LEARNED  ANYTHING. AND THIS EXTREME IDEOLOGY IS  PARTICULARLY BAD. LOOK AT VIRGINIA. THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR  GOVERNOR KEN CUCCINELLI IS AS  FAR RIGHT AS THEY COME. HE THINKS SAME-SEX RELATIONSHIPS ARE IMMORAL, WANTS TO BAN  ABORTIONS WITH NO EXCEPTION, AND ONCE SAID IT&#39;S POSSIBLE THE  PRESIDENT WAS BORN IN KENYA. AND HE&#39;S PLUNGING IN THE POLLS. 12 POINTS BEHIND. SO WHY IS THAT? PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS IN VIRGINIA  OVER THE WEEKEND WITH THE  ANSWER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU&#39;VE SEEN ON EXTREME  FACTION OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY  THAT HAS SHOWN AGAIN AND AGAIN  AND AGAIN THAT THEY&#39;RE WILLING  TO HIJACK THE ECONOMY AND THE  COUNTRY AND GRIND TO A HALT IF  THEY DON&#39;T GET 100% OF WHAT THEY WANT. NOW --  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE EXTREMISTS ARE HIJACKING  THE ENTIRE PARTY AND ONE YEAR  LATER THEY HAVEN&#39;T LEARNED  ANYTHING. JOINING ME NOW ARE JOAN WALSH  AND CYNTHIA TUCKER. THANKS FOR JOINING ME. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; GOOD TO BE HERE, REVEREND. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; JOAN, THE PRESIDENT TALKED  ABOUT HIJACKING THE COUNTRY. A YEAR LATER, THEY DID NOT LEARN ANYTHING. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S BEEN A LOST YEAR FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. AND WE&#39;RE REALLY FEELING IT AS  WE SIT AND WATCH WHAT&#39;S GOING ON IN VIRGINIA. THEY&#39;VE NOMINATED SOMEBODY WHO  IS JUST A TOTAL EXTREMIST. THEY&#39;RE BLOCKING ACTION ON  IMMIGRATION REFORM, SO THEY&#39;RE  DOING NOTHING TO APPEAL TO  LATINOS. THEY&#39;VE REALLY -- CUCCINELLI  CONTINUES TO INSIST THAT THIS IS A REFERENDUM ON OBAMA CARE AND  ROLLOUT PROBLEMS ASIDE AND WE  KNOW WE&#39;VE SEEN THOSE, WE KNOW  THAT WOMEN LOVE OBAMA CARE. SO NOT JUST ABORTION, NOT JUST  ALL THIS RHETORIC AND ACTION IF  HE GOT ELECTED ON ABORTION IS  PROBLEMATIC FOR WOMEN, BUT OBAMA CARE AS WELL. OBAMA CARE HAS REALLY HELPED  WOMEN BY MAKING SURE THAT WOMEN  ARE NO LONGER PAYING MORE THAN  MEN FOR THE SIMPLE FACT OF  BRINGING THE NEXT GENERATION  INTO THE WORLD. AND REPUBLICANS HATE THIS. BUT WOMEN LOVE IT. SO THEY&#39;VE REALLY -- THEY SPENT  A YEAR IN THE WILDERNESS AND  THEY&#39;RE NOT GETTING OUT ANY TIME SOON. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, CYNTHIA, IN LINE  WITH THAT, THE HOUSE SPEAKER  JOHN BOEHNER TODAY SAID HE&#39;S  OPPOSING THE NON-DISCRIMINATION  ACT. HIS SPOKESPERSON ISSUED THIS  STATEMENT, QUOTE, THE SPEAKER  BELIEVES THIS LEGISLATION WILL  INCREASE FRIVOLOUS LITIGATION  AND COST AMERICAN JOBS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S STUNNING, REVEREND AL. IT IS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING TO SEE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY RUNNING  AWAY. THIS IS A PARTY THAT&#39;S EMBRACING EVERY RIGHT WING NOSTRUM THAT  THEY CAN THINK OF. THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS  SUPPORT GAY RIGHTS. CERTAINLY THEY SUPPORT PEOPLE TO HAVE JOBS, NOT TO BE  DISCRIMINATED AGAINST IN THE  WORKPLACE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS  SUPPORT A DIVERSE AMERICA. AND EVEN WITH THE PROBLEMS THAT  OBAMA CARE IS HAVING, MOST  AMERICANS BELIEVE PEOPLE OUGHT  TO BE ABLE TO GET AFFORDABLE  HEALTH CARE. SO, YOU KNOW, IN 30 YEARS OF  COVERING POLITICS, I HAVE NEVER  SEEN A POLITICAL PARTY THAT TIME AND TIME AGAIN EMBRACES THE  THINGS THAT MOST PEOPLE DO NOT  WANT. IT&#39;S A SUREFIRE LOSING STRATEGY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN, IT SEEMS THEY ARE DOING THAT. IN VIRGINIA, PRESIDENT OBAMA  TALKED ABOUT HOW VOTERS REMEMBER ACTIONS OF THE EXTREME, JOAN. LISTEN TO THIS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IF YOU EMBRACE THE VERY  POLITICS THAT LED TO THIS  SHUTDOWN, THEN I GUARANTEE IT&#39;S  NOT IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR OF  VOTERS IN VIRGINIA. THEY REMEMBER. THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THAT IS NOT HOW YOU GOVERN OR MOVE AMERICA  FORWARD. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; VOTERS ARE GOING TO REMEMBER, PARTICULARLY VIRGINIA WITH SO  MANY GOVERNMENT WORKERS, BUT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY VOTERS WILL  REMEMBER TOMORROW THE SHUTDOWN  THAT WE JUST GOT OVER WITHIN THE LAST 30 DAYS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, AND KEN CUCCINELLI,  MAYBE HE DOESN&#39;T EVEN WANT TO  WIN, REVEREND AL. BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, HE KNOWS THAT THE SHUTDOWN HURT HIS CHANCES. HE KNOWS IT WAS VERY, VERY  UNPOPULAR IN VIRGINIA. SO WHAT DOES HE DO? HE BRINGS IN RAND PAUL AND MARCO RUBIO WHO BOTH VOTED TO CONTINUE THE SHUTDOWN. SO ON THE ONE HAND, HE MADE SOME NOISES ABOUT MAYBE IT WASN&#39;T THE BEST WAY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS,  BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. BUT HE BRINGS IN HEROES OF THE  SHUTDOWN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BUT AT THE SAME TIME,  CYNTHIA, THAT HE BROUGHT IN  HEROES OF THE SHUTDOWN, HE TRIED TO HAVE IT BOTH WAYS WHEN TED  CRUZ CAME INTO VIRGINIA. AND THE VICE PRESIDENT AND THE  DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE THAT HE&#39;S  OPPOSES TERRY McAULIFFE, THEY  LINKED KEN CUCCINELLI TO TED  CRUZ. JUST LISTEN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO GOVERN  IN WHAT THEY HOPE TO BE A NEW  TRADITION OF TED CRUZ. YOU MIGHT REMEMBER TED CRUZ JUST GAVE US THE SHUTDOWN TERRY JUST  TALKED ABOUT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; COULD YOU IMAGINE IF TED  CRUZ, KEN CUCCINELLI, AND THE  TEA PARTY ACTUALLY RAN THE  VIRGINIA GOVERNMENT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOW, LET&#39;S NOT FORGET,  CYNTHIA, JUST LAST MONTH  CUCCINELLI SHUNNED TED CRUZ AT  EVEN A PHOTOGRAPH IN VIRGINIA. HE AVOIDED BEING PHOTOGRAPHED  WITH THE SHUTDOWN KING. I MEAN, SO EVEN WITH CUCCINELLI  REALIZING THAT CRUZ WAS TAXIC,  HE HANGS OUT WITH THE OTHER GUYS THAT VOTED FOR THE SHUTDOWN. WHAT DOES THIS TELL YOU OF THE  OVERREACH OF THE EXTREME RIGHT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HE CAN&#39;T RUN AWAY FROM THIS  RECORD. HE HAS A LONG RECORD OF  EMBRACING THE MOST EXTREME  POSITIONS. SO HE MIGHT AS WELL HANG OUT  WITH TED CRUZ. BUT THE OTHER THING THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY IS STUCK WITH,  REVEREND AL, IS ITS OWN BASE. THERE IS A VERSE IN THE BIBLE  THAT TALKS ABOUT SEWING THE WIND AND REAPING THE WHIRLWIND. AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS DONE. IT HAS SPENT DECADES PANDERING  TO EXTREMISTS. PEOPLE WHO HATE THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT, PEOPLE WHO WANT TO  DESTROY THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET  FOR THE POOR. PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT COMFORTABLE  WITH THE DIVERSE AMERICA. AND THEY CAN&#39;T RUN AWAY FROM  THOSE PEOPLE NOW. THOSE PEOPLE ARE THE TEA PARTY. THEY&#39;RE BASE VOTERS. AND THE PARTY CAN&#39;T RUN AWAY  FROM THEM. THE ESTABLISHMENT THOUGHT THAT  THEY WOULD JUST BE ABLE TO USE  THEIR VOTES AND CONTROL THE TEA  PARTY&#39;S ENERGY, BUT THEY CANNOT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; REAPING THE WHIRLWIND. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; EXACTLY. THEY&#39;RE REAPING THE WHIRLWIND. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, JOAN, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT FACT THAT ABOUT A YEAR  AGO WHEN WE HAD THE ELECTION  ALMOST A YEAR AGO EXACTLY IN A  COUPLE OF DAYS, IF YOU LOOKED AT 2012, IN THE RATINGS, THE  OPINION POLLS, THE RATINGS OF  OCTOBER 2012 A MONTH BEFORE, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WAS DOING 26%  IN APPROVAL. AFTER ALL THE TALK OF CHANGE,  WHAT HAS HAPPENED? THEY&#39;RE NOW DOWN TO 22%. THE LOWEST ON RECORD. IT&#39;S AN UNBELIEVABLE SLIDE FOR A PARTY THAT PLEDGED TO REBRAND  AND HAVE AN AUTOPSY. THEY&#39;VE GONE DOWN TO 22%. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YEAH. THE OTHER THING YOU SEE IN THE  VIRGINIA RACE, REVEREND AL, IS  THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS  AMAZINGLY UNIFIED. THERE ARE DIFFERENCES AT THE  MARGINS, BUT YOU HAVE BILL AND  HILLARY CLINTON THERE IN  VIRGINIA. YOU&#39;VE GOT PRESIDENT OBAMA. YOU&#39;VE GOT VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN. PEOPLE ARE COMING OUT. IT&#39;S A UNIFIED PARTY THAT KNOWS  WHAT IT STANDS FOR AND THAT IS  REALLY TRYING TO MAKE VIRGINIA A WAKEUP CALL TO THE REST OF THE  COUNTRY THAT REPUBLICANS LEARNED NOTHING FROM THEIR DRUBBING IN  2014. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ALSO IN THE YEAR, THE  REPUBLICANS REALLY HAVEN&#39;T  CHANGED THEIR AGENDA. I MEAN, WHEN WE LOOK AT THE FACT LAST YEAR MITT ROMNEY&#39;S 47%  COMMENT DEFINED THE ELECTION,  NOW REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS ARE  PUSHING A MEASURE TO CUT $40  BILLION FROM FOOD STAMPS. LAST YEAR REPUBLICANS PUSHING A  VARIETY OF VOTER I.D. BILLS. THIS YEAR THEIR PLAN TO PUSH NEW VOTER I.D. BILLS. LAST YEAR THEY VOWED TO DEFEAT  THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. THIS YEAR, DRUM ROLL, THEY&#39;RE  VOWING TO DEFEAT THE AFFORDABLE  CARE ACT. THEY HAVEN&#39;T CHANGED ANYTHING. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND REMEMBER THEY SPENT A LOT OF TIME AFTER THEIR LOSS A YEAR  AGO TALKING ABOUT IMMIGRATION  REFORM.

SO WE&#39;VE JUST GOT TO KEEP ON  WORKING. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; PRESIDENT OBAMA JUST MOMENTS  AGO TALKING TO GRASSROOTS  SUPPORTERS ABOUT THE GOP&#39;S FIGHT AGAINST HIS HEALTH CARE LAW. RIGHT WING SPEND MACHINE HAS  BEEN PEDDLING FALSE AND  MISLEADING INFORMATION ABOUT  OBAMA CARE. USING STORIES ABOUT THE TINY  FRACTION OF PEOPLE WHO WILL HAVE TO SHIFT THEIR COVERAGE. FOX NEWS HAS POUNCED ON PEOPLE  LIKE DIANE BARRETTE. WITH ONE OF THOSE STORIES. JUST WATCH HOW FOX USED HER TO  TROT OUT THEIR TIRED OLD TALKING POINTS ABOUT THE LAW. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; DID THIS HAPPEN TO YOU? A FLORIDA WOMAN FINDS OUT SHE  HAS TO PAY TEN TIMES AS MUCH FOR HEALTH INSURANCE THAT IS BECAUSE SHE&#39;S USING HER CURRENT PLAN TO  OBAMA CARE. I GOT A COPY OF YOUR FLORIDA  BLUE INSURANCE. AND ABOUT $54 A MONTH. NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT UNDER  OBAMA CARE IT&#39;S GOING TO GO UP  AT LEAST THEY SAID THAT THE  POLICY THEY WOULD OFFER YOU  UNDER FLORIDA BLUE WOULD BE  $591. IS THAT CORRECT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S CORRECT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BUT ALL THAT SPIN HIDES THE  TRUTH. A NEW REPUBLIC REPORTER TRACKED  DIANE DOWN AND EXPLAINED HOW  OBAMA CARE PLANS COULD PROVIDE  MUCH BETTER COVERAGE AND FOR  JUST $50 TO $100 MORE A MONTH. HER RESPONSE, QUOTE, I WOULD  JUMP AT IT. WITH MY AGE THINGS CAN HAPPEN. I DON&#39;T WANT TO HAVE BILLS THAT  COULD MAKE ME BANKRUPT. I DON&#39;T WANT TO LOSE MY HOUSE. I WOULD JUMP AT IT. AS WOULD MILLIONS OF AMERICANS  WHO DON&#39;T HAVE INSURANCE OR WHO  HAVE INSURANCE SO BAD IT DOESN&#39;T REALLY COVER ANYTHING ANYWAY. RIGHT WINGERS ARE HELL BENT ON  SABOTAGING OBAMA CARE ANY WAY  THEY CAN. BUT THEY CAN&#39;T STOP AMERICANS  FROM LEARNING HOW THE LAW WORKS  FOR EVERYONE. JOINING ME NOW IS &quot;WASHINGTON  POST&quot; JONATHAN CAPEHART. THANKS FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HI, REV. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; JONATHAN, YOUR COLUMN TODAY  POINTS OUT THE GOP HYPOCRISY ON  ALL THIS. YOU WRITE, QUOTE, WHAT THE GOP  GLEEFULLY CALLS A TRAIN WRECK  WAS A SELF-FULFILLING PROPHECY  OF REPUBLICAN SABOTAGE. SO REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN  FIGHTING AGAINST THE LAW FOR  YEARS, AND NOW THEY&#39;RE SPREADING LIES ABOUT IT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; OH, YEAH. SEE, HERE&#39;S THE THING. REPUBLICAN PARTY HAVE BEEN  TRYING TO KILL THE AFFORDABLE  CARE ACT SINCE BEFORE IT BECAME  THE LAW OF THE LAND. THEY THOUGHT THE SUPREME COURT  WOULD DO THE WORK FOR IT BY  DECLARING IT UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THAT DIDN&#39;T HAPPEN. IN TERMS OF TRYING TO IMPLEMENT  THE LAW FIRST SAYS T&quot;THE  WASHINGTON POST&quot; SAID IN THE  PAPER WAS THEY BASICALLY STARVED THE FEDERAL EXCHANGES OF MONEY. SO ALL THOSE STATE EXCHANGES  THAT WERE ALL, YOU KNOW,  APPLAUDING AND CHEERING AND  WORKING PERFECTLY WELL, THERE  WAS FUNDING FOR THOSE EXCHANGES. BUT THE FEDERAL EXCHANGE, NO  MONEY. IN FACT, JULIETTE REPORTS THAT  KATHLEEN SEBELIUS COULDN&#39;T FIND  ENOUGH MONEY TO KEEP PROGRAMMERS UNDER HER WING AND SO WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING WAS ALL OF THE  RESPONSIBILITIES WERE FRAGMENTED TO SEVERAL OFFICES IN DIFFERENT  LOCATIONS. SO WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING IS THE TRAIN WRECK THAT THE REPUBLICANS PREDICTED WOULD HAPPEN CAME TRUE LARGELY IN PART BECAUSE OF WHAT  REPUBLICANS DID TO TRY TO DERAIL THE LAW. NOW, THAT&#39;S NOT TO SAY THAT  THERE WEREN&#39;T MISTAKES,  MISCALCULATIONS, POLITICAL  TIMIDITY ON THE WHITE HOUSE&#39;S  PART. BUT AT LEAST THE WHITE HOUSE IS  TRYING TO DO SOMETHING  AFFIRMATIVE, DO SOMETHING  POSITIVE FOR PEOPLE WHO DON&#39;T  HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE. THE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SABOTAGE A LAW WITH NO  ALTERNATIVE TO REPLACE IT WITH. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND WHAT YOU SAID JUST NOW  INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH SEEMS TO BE WHERE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE,  JONATHAN. BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE  POLLS, THE PUBLIC STILL WANTS TO GIVE OBAMA CARE A CHANCE. 47% WANT TO KEEP OR EXPAND THE  LAW. ONLY 24% WANT TO SEE THE LAW  REPEALED. AND 13% SAY THEY WANT THE LAW  REPEALED AND REPLACED WITH A  REPUBLICAN SPONSORED  ALTERNATIVE. CLEARLY NOT A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE FOR THE REPUBLICANS. 13%. AND CLEARLY 47% SAYING WE WANT  TO KEEP OR EXPAND OBAMA CARE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YEAH. AND IMAGINE WHAT THE NUMBERS  WOULD BE LIKE IF THE REPUBLICANS ACTUALLY HAD A VIABLE  ALTERNATIVE TO THE LAW THAT  THEY&#39;RE TRYING TO KILL. ONE. AND TWO, WOULDN&#39;T IT BE NICE IF  THE REPUBLICAN PARTY RATHER THAN TRYING TO KILL SETTLED LAW  WORKED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION  AND DEMOCRATS IN THE HOUSE AND  SENATE TO MAKE THE LAW BETTER. NO ONE&#39;S SAYING THAT THE LAW IS  PERFECT. BUT CERTAINLY IT -- YOU KNOW,  THE WAY GOVERNMENT IS SUPPOSED  TO WORK IS THAT THE OPPOSITION  LOOKS FOR A PROBLEM AND TRIES TO SAY HERE&#39;S OUR PLAN TO MAKE IT  BETTER. AND HERE&#39;S WHY YOU SHOULD FOCUS  ON WHAT WE&#39;RE DOING. THAT&#39;S NOT WHAT THE REPUBLICANS  ARE DOING AT ALL IN THIS CASE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NO. I THINK THAT&#39;S TELLING. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE REPUBLICAN  PLAN, THE ONLY ONE WE SAW WAS  ROMNEY CARE, MASSACHUSETTS. THAT&#39;S RIGHT. THAT&#39;S WHERE OBAMA CARE EMANATED A LOT OF ITS IDEAS. SO THEY CAN&#39;T QUOTE THAT. GOING TO HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS  EVENING. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THANKS A LOT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt;&gt; COMING UP, THE BILLIONAIRES  RIGHT WINGERS BANK ROLLING THESE CREEPY ADS HAVE A NEW PLAN TO  ATTACK DEMOCRATS TODAY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt;&gt; AND GET READY.

NOW THEY HAVE A NEW PLAN. CHARLES AND DAVID KOCH, THE  SECRETIVE TEA PARTY BILLIONAIRE  BROTHERS, ARE AT IT AGAIN. THEY SPENT $60 MILLION TO DERAIL PRESIDENT OBAMA AND SECRETLY  FUNNEL MONEY TO TEA PARTY GROUPS AT AN UNDERCOVER MEETING IN  2011. ONE WAS CAUGHT SAYING THIS ABOUT THE 2012 ELECTION. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THIS IS THE MOTHER OF ALL  WARS WE&#39;VE GOT THE NEXT 18  MONTHS. FOR THE LIFE OR DEATH OF THIS  COUNTRY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THEY LOST THE MOTHER OF ALL  WARS. AND AFTER THE ELECTION, DAVID  KOCH TOLD FORBES, QUOTE, WE&#39;RE  NOT GOING TO ROLL OVER AND PLAY  DEAD. AND TODAY WE&#39;RE SEEING WHAT HE  MEANT. &quot;THE NEW YORK TIMES&quot; REPORTS THE KOCH-BACKED TEA PARTY GROUP  AMERICANS FOR PROSPERITY IS  GOING LOCAL. IT&#39;S TRYING TO SWAY THE MAYOR  AND CITY COUNCIL RACES IN A  SMALL TOWN IN IOWA. THE GROUP&#39;S ALSO BEEN INVOLVED  IN PROPERTY TAX FIGHTS IN  KANSAS, OHIO, AND TEXAS. THE NEWS COMES -- THIS NEWS  COMES JUST WEEKS AFTER &quot;THE  TIMES&quot; REPORTED THE KOCHS WERE,  QUOTE, DEEPLY INVOLVED WITH  GROUPS THAT PLOTTED THE  GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. AND GAVE MILLIONS TO ANOTHER  GROUP THAT MADE THE CREEPY UNCLE SAM ADS. TRYING TO SCARE PEOPLE NOT TO  GET HEALTH INSURANCE. HERE&#39;S HOW THEY GOT INTO THE  HALLOWEEN SPIRIT. * &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOW THE FEAR CAMPAIGN COULD  BE COMING TO YOUR LOCAL TOWN. AND JUST LIKE LAST YEAR, THE  FIGHT IS ON. JOINING ME NOW ARE KRYSTAL BALL  AND JAMES PETERSON. THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THANKS FOR HAVING US, REV. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; KRYSTAL, A KOCH-BACKED TEA  PARTY GROUP GETTING INVOLVED IN  IOWA CITY COUNCIL RACE. WHAT&#39;S THE STRATEGY HERE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE KOCHS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN  WILLING TO PUSH THEIR IDEOLOGIES AT ALL LEVELS. THESE ARE THE GUYS ALSO BEHIND  THE AMERICAN LEGISLATIVE  EXCHANGE COUNCIL. AND THEY PUSHED THEIR AGENDA  THROUGH MODEL LEGISLATION THAT  WAS ANTI-WORKER AND PRO-BIG  BUSINESS AT THE STATE LEVEL  ACROSS THE COUNTRY. SO THIS IS SOMETHING THEY&#39;VE  BEEN DOING IN DIFFERENT WAYS  ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I THINK THE FOCUS ON THE LOCAL,  LOCAL LEVEL IS RELATIVELY NEW,  THOUGH, AND PARTICULARLY  INSIDIOUS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, JAMES, IF YOU LOOK  BACK AT JUST HOW INVOLVED THE  KOCHS WERE IN 2012, NAY  PERSONALLY PLEDGED TO SPENT $60  MILLION. A KOCH OPERATIVE RAN A SECRET  BANK THAT DONATED $236 MILLION  TO CONSERVATIVE CAUSES. LEADERS OF THE PARTY GO TO THEIR EVENTS. AND EVEN SENT A LETTER TO  THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES TELLING  THEM TO VOTE. INCLUDING A FRIENDLY REMINDER  THAT THE COMPANY ENDORSED MITT  ROMNEY. I MEAN, IT WAS A MULTI-PRONGED  APPROACH. DOES THAT SAY TO YOU? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHAT IT DOES IS IT OUTLINES  THE SORT OF SELF-CENTERED AND  SINISTER INTENT OF THE KOCH  BROTHERS AND ALL OF THE  AFFILIATES AND ORGANIZATIONS  THAT THEY FUND. YOU KNOW, WHAT&#39;S GOING ON IN  IOWA IS PARTICULARLY SORT OF  IMPORTANT FOR US TO FOCUS IN ON. BECAUSE IT MAY LOOK LIKE SMALL  TOWN POLITICS, BUT ACTUALLY THE  IDEOLOGY BEHIND THEIR  INVOLVEMENT IS THEY WANT TO  ESSENTIALLY PIT BIG BUSINESS  VERSUS GOVERNMENT. THEY&#39;RE MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN  EVADING TAXES FOR BUSINESS AND  PRIVATIZING DIFFERENT PUBLIC  ENTITIES THAN THEY ARE ACTUALLY  ALLOWING ELECTIONS TO UNFOLD IN  THE WAYS THAT LOCAL ELECTIONS  SHOULD UNFOLD. THEY TAKE THAT AT EVERY LEVEL. AT THE VERY LOCAL LEVEL OF  CITIES AND MUNICIPALITIES, THEY  WANT TO DO IT AT THE STATE  LEVEL. AND THEY ALSO WANT TO DO IT AT  THE FEDERAL LEVEL DUMPING  MILLIONS, TENS OF MILLIONS OF  DOLLARS INTO PRESIDENTIAL  ELECTIONS. AGAIN, THEY&#39;RE THE TEXTBOOK CASE OF WHY WE HAVE TO GET MONEY OUT  OF POLITICS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, IT&#39;S ALSO  INTERESTING, KRYSTAL, AS I SAID  IN THE OPENING OF THIS SEGMENT  THAT THEY SAID THEY&#39;RE NOT GOING TO ROLL OVER AND PLAY DEAD. AND HERE WE SEE IT BEING  DEMONSTRATED AND MANIFESTING  ITSELF IN LOCAL ELECTIONS. BUT THE PRESIDENT LATELY HAS  BEEN CALLING OUT BILLIONAIRES  WITH AN OUTSIZE INFLUENCE ON  POLITICS. TAKE A LISTEN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THERE AREN&#39;T A LOT OF  FUNCTIONING DEMOCRACIES AROUND  THE WORLD THAT WORK THIS WAY. WHERE YOU CAN BASICALLY HAVE  MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES  BANK ROLLING WHOEVER THEY WANT,  HOWEVER THEY WANT, IN SOME CASES UNDISCLOSED AND WHAT IT MEANS IS ORDINARY AMERICANS ARE SHUT OUT  OF THE PROCESS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ORDINARY AMERICANS ARE SHUT  OUT OF THE PROCESS, THE  PRESIDENT SAYS. HOW CAN THIS BIG MONEY BE  COUNTERED? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, THAT&#39;S THE  MILLION-DOLLAR QUESTION AT THIS  POINT GIVEN WHAT THE SUPREME  COURT HAS DONE. PUN INTENDED. GIVEN WHAT THE SUPREME COURT HAS DONE, IT&#39;S GIVEN US VERY  LITTLE -- VERY FEW AVENUES TO  ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF MONEY IN  POLITICS WITHOUT GOING FORWARD  WITH A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. AT THIS POINT THE ONLY THING YOU COULD DO IS TRY TO COUNTER THAT  MONEY. AS WE DID I THINK IN 2012 WITH  CITIZEN ACTIVISM. THERE&#39;S STILL NOTHING MORE  POWERFUL THAN PEOPLE GETTING OUT AND PRESSURING THEIR  LEGISLATORS. BUT I THINK WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS A SORT OF TRICKLE-UP EFFECT FROM THE KOCH BROTHERS MONEY AT  REPUBLICAN LEVEL AND AT THE  LOCAL AND STATE LEVEL. THE REASON THEY HAVE A SORT OF  BULLETPROOF MAJORITY IN THE  HOUSE RIGHT NOW IS BECAUSE THEY  WERE SO SUCCESSFUL GETTING  PEOPLE IN PLACE TO RUN FOR STATE LEGISLATORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY  IN 2013. SO THEY WERE ABLE TO DRAW  DISTRICTS AND GERRYMANDER  DISTRICTS TO THEIR FAVOR WHICH  IS GOING TO HELP THEM  POTENTIALLY KEEP CONTROL OF THE  HOUSE IN 2014.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BUT THEY HAVE BEEN COUNTED IN SOME WAYS IN THE STATE OF  CALIFORNIA, JAMES, THE STATE OF  CALIFORNIA RECENTLY FINED TWO  GROUPS. ONE WITH TIES TO THE KOCH  BROTHERS, A MILLION DOLLARS FOR  VIOLATING CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS. AND THEY CALLED A VICTORY OVER  DARK MONEY. AFTER CITIZENS UNITED, DO WE  HAVE TO RELY ON STATES TO BE  AGGRESSIVE ABOUT REQUIRING  GROUPS TO DISCLOSE THEIR  POLITICAL DONORS, DR. PETERSON? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, I DO BELIEVE THAT WE  HAVE TO -- UNTIL WE&#39;RE GOING TO  SORT OF REPEAL THE SUPREME COURT DECISION OR AS KRYSTAL SUGGESTS  GET SOME CONSTITUTIONAL  AMENDMENTS TO MAKE A MORE ROBUST MODEL FOR CAMPAIGN MEASURING OF  FINANCES, I THINK WE HAVE TO  MEET THEM BOTH WHERE THEY ARE AS MOVEMENTS, WITH CITIZENS ENGAGED IN POLITICAL PROCESSES COMING  OUT TO VOTE. AND YES AT THE STATE LEVEL. REMEMBER, DEMOCRATS DON&#39;T  CONTROL A WHOLE LOT OF STATES. BUT PEOPLE HAVE GOT TO PRESS  THEIR LEGISLATORS AND MAKE SURE  THEY&#39;RE PAYING ATTENTION TO  WHAT&#39;S GOING ON. OTHERWISE PRIVATIZATION, LARGE  BUSINESSES, AND THE 1% WILL  CONTINUE TO DOMINATE POLITICS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, KRYSTAL, PRESIDENT  OBAMA&#39;S SPEAKING TONIGHT TO THE  GRASSROOTS GROUPS ORGANIZING FOR AMERICA. AND THEY JUST PUT OUT THIS AD. ABOUT A YOUNG MAN GOING HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS. CHECK IT OUT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHAT THE HECK DO THEY WANT TO TALK TO ME ABOUT? SO WHAT&#39;S SO IMPORTANT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOUR DAD AND I ARE MOVING IN  WITH YOU. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ROOMIES! &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE KNOW WHAT YOU DID IN  VEGAS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE KNOW WHAT YOU DID AT MARDI GRAS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST  SUMMER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SO WHAT DID YOU WANT TO TALK  TO ME ABOUT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE KNOW YOU DON&#39;T HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE LOVE YOU NO MATTER WHAT,  BUT IT&#39;S TIME TO GET COVERED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S IT? HEALTH INSURANCE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOW, THIS AD IS ENCOURAGING  PARENTS TO TALK TO THEIR KIDS  ABOUT GETTING INSURED. IS THIS A WAY TO TAKE ON CREEPY  UNCLE SAM COMMERCIALS? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, IT&#39;S CERTAINLY, I WOULD SAY, A MORE MORAL MESSAGE VERSUS UNCLE SAM WHICH WAS ENCOURAGING  YOUNG PEOPLE NOT TO GET HEALTH  INSURANCE WHICH I THINK IS  OUTRAGEOUS THAT YOU WOULD THINK  IT IS OKAY TO TRY TO CONVINCE  YOUNG PEOPLE THAT THEY SHOULD  ROLL THE DICE AND GO WITHOUT  HEALTH INSURANCE RATHER THAN DO  ANYTHING TO SUPPORT THIS  PRESIDENT. I THINK THIS WILL HELP. WE&#39;RE SEEING NUMBERS FROM THE  WEBSITE IN NEW REPORTS NOW THAT  ARE SHOWING YOUNG PEOPLE ARE  GOING TO THE WEBSITE. THEY&#39;RE INTERESTED IN GETTING  COVERED. IF WE COULD GET THE GLITCHES  WORKED OUT ON THE WEBSITE, I  THINK WE&#39;LL BE SUCCESSFUL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; KRYSTAL BALL AND JAMES  PETERSON, THANKS FOR YOUR TIME. BEFORE WE GO, A NOTE.

A VIRGINIA MOTHER LET HER  7-YEAR-OLD SON DRESS AS A MEMBER OF THE KU KLUX KLAN. WHY WOULD SHE ALLOW SUCH AN  OFFENSIVE OUTFIT? WELL, BECAUSE OF FAMILY  TRADITION. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; MY BROTHER HAS WHEN HE WAS IN KINDERGARTEN AND WHEN HE WAS 13. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S WHY JESSICA BLACK&#39;S  SON ASKED IF HE COULD ALSO DRESS AS A MEMBER, SHE MADE THE  COSTUME FOR HIM.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT WAS COOL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHAT WAS COOL ABOUT IT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE HAT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I DID TELL HIM, YOU KNOW, IF  YOU DO IT THERE&#39;S GOING TO BE  PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT YOU. THERE&#39;S GOING TO BE PEOPLE THAT  SAY BAD THINGS TO YOU WHEN YOU  WEAR IT. IT&#39;S SUPPOSED TO BE WHITE WITH  WHITE, BLACK WITH BLACK, MAN  WITH WOMAN. THAT&#39;S WHAT THE KKK STANDS FOR. THEY RAISE MONEY EVERY YEAR TO  DONATE TO ST. JUDES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SO BECAUSE THEY DONATE TO  CHARITY, HER SON CAN WEAR THAT  HATEFUL OUTFIT? THAT MAKES NO SENSE. BUT IT&#39;S THAT OUTDATED LOGIC  THAT WE&#39;RE SEEING SPRING UP ALL  OVER THE COUNTRY. WE SAW IT RECENTLY WHEN A MAN  WAVED A CONFEDERATE FLAG OUTSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE. AND REMEMBER THE MISSISSIPPI  SENATE CANDIDATE WHO REPORTEDLY  ATTENDED TWO EVENTS PUT ON BY A  NEO-NAZI CONFEDERATE GROUP? WELL, TODAY THE BIGGEST TEA  PARTY GROUP WILL SUPPORT HIM. AND TODAY IN COLORADO, VOTERS IN TEN COUNTIES WILL VOTE TO SECEDE FROM THE STATE. A CONSERVATIVE BLOCK OF COLORADO TO LOOKING TO BREAK FREE. THEY WANT TO FORM THEIR OWN  STATE. NORTHERN COLORADO. AND ALL OF THIS COMES AS MORE  AND MORE PUNDITS COMPARE THE  OBAMA POLICIES THEY DON&#39;T LIKE  TO SLAVERY. ONE WHOLE SIDE OF THE AISLE IS  PARTYING LIKE IT&#39;S 1860. WHO&#39;S GOING TO TELL THEM THEY&#39;RE 150 YEARS BEHIND THE TIMES? JOINING ME NOW ARE JOE MADISON  AND BILL PRESS. THANK YOU BOTH FOR COMING ON THE SHOW TONIGHT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; GOOD TO SEE YOU. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BEFORE WE GOET TO THE LARGER  POLITICAL DISCUSSION, LET&#39;S GO  BACK TO THIS SHOCKING PICTURE,  SKROE. WHY ON EARTH WOULD A MOTHER  THINK IT&#39;S OKAY TO LET HER  7-YEAR-OLD SON WEAR A KKK OUTFIT FOR HALLOWEEN? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE MOTHER IS IN ONE  SINGLE WORD, VERY IGNORANT. TO SIT UP THERE AND JUSTIFY IT  BECAUSE IT&#39;S WHITE ON WHITE,  BLACK ON BLACK, MAN/WOMAN, THAT  TYPE OF THING, MAYBE HOPEFULLY  THE TEACHER MIGHT STEP IN AND  SAY, YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE SHOULD  SHOW THE PBS SPECIAL ON THE REAL KKK. BY THE WAY, THAT ENDED UP BEING  TOTALLY EMBARRASSED IN INDIANA  BECAUSE THEY WERE MISOGYNISTIC. THEY WERE CROOKED. THEY WENT TO JAIL. THEY LYNCHED PEOPLE. WE ALL KNOW THE HISTORY. I HAVE A 7-YEAR-OLD GRANDSON WHO QUITE HONESTLY HAS MORE COMMON  SENSE THAN THAT MOTHER, AND I  WOULD END BY SAYING QUITE  HONESTLY IF I LIVED IN THE  COUNTRY, I&#39;D HAVE THE CHILD  ABUSE AUTHORITIES ON THAT  MOTHER. BECAUSE THIS IS ABUSIVE. THIS IS TEACHING THAT CHILD TO  HATE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BILL PRESS? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I&#39;VE GOT TO ECHO THAT. THAT KID IS GOING TO GROW UP  THINKING THE KK IS SOMETHING  CUTE, SOMETHING JOKE THAT ADULTS WILL SEE AND LAUGH AT OTHER THAN BEING TOLD BY THAT MOTHER THAT  WHAT THE KKK STANDS FOR IS  FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG. THAT WAS A TEACHING MOMENT FOR  HER. SHE SURE MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE MISSISSIPPI STATE SENATOR WITH THOSE NEOCONFEDERATE LINKS. I SAID NEO-NAZI CONFEDERATE  LINKS. CHRIS McDANIEL SAYS HE ONLY  ATTENDED ONE AS OPPOSED TO TWO  OF THE NOEO-CONFEDERATE EVENTS. IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MAKE THINGS  BETTER? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NO. SO YOU ATTENDED ONE. BUT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A  FREUDIAN SLIP ON YOUR PART TO  SAY NEO-NAZI. COULD YOU IMAGINE IF HE HAD  ATTENDED, LET&#39;S SAY, A NEO-NAZI  EVENT, WHAT THE IMPACT WOULD  HAVE BEEN? CAN YOU IMAGINE IF THAT  7-YEAR-OLD HAD DRESSED UP AS A  NAZI STORM TROOPER. WHAT THE LEGITIMATE RESPONSE  WOULD HAVE BEEN. I THINK THAT&#39;S EXACTLY HOW WE AS COMMON SENSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS. BUT THAT 7-YEAR-OLD WILL  PROBABLY AS BILL PRESS SAID,  GROW UP TO BE THAT STATE  LEGISLATOR OR THAT ELECTED  OFFICIAL AND CARRY ON THIS AWFUL TRADITION. YOU ASKED THE QUESTION EARLY ON, AL. WHO&#39;S GOING TO TELL THESE PEOPLE THAT THEY&#39;RE 150 YEARS BEHIND. WE ARE. THAT&#39;S WHAT WE&#39;VE GOT TO DO. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, BILL, THE RIGHT  WING CONSPIRACY BLOCK IS NOW  ARGUING THAT, QUOTE, HITLER  WOULD BE PLEASED WITH PRESIDENT  OBAMA. I MEAN, WHY IS THIS SCARY? BECAUSE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS READ THIS WEBSITE. CONGRESSMAN STEVE STOCKMAN IS  EVEN HANDING OUT THE COPIES OF  THE WEBSITE&#39;S OBAMA IMPEACHMENT  BOOK TO EVERY MEMBER OF  CONGRESS, BILL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THERE&#39;S SO MUCH GOING ON  HERE. FIRST OF ALL, I&#39;VE GOT TO SAY  THERE&#39;S A COMMON THREAD HERE  WITH THIS GUY DOWN IN  MISSISSIPPI AND WITH THIS NAZI  TALK. THIS IS THE TEA PARTY MANTRA. REMEMBER THE TEA PARTY IS  ESSENTIALLY A RACIST  ORGANIZATION. LET&#39;S JUST BE HONEST ABOUT THAT. WE SAW IT FROM THE VERY  BEGINNING WITH THE WHITE FACE  THEY USED TO WEAR AT THE  RALLIES, WITH THE POSTERS THEY  USED TO HANG AROUND, WITH THE  CONFEDERATE FLAGS THAT I SAW AT  TEA PARTY RALLIES HERE ON THE  WASHINGTON MALL, AND THE SOURCE  OF THAT TEA PARTY MOVEMENT IS  THAT THEY&#39;VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO  ACCEPT BARACK OBAMA AS A  LEGITIMATE PRESIDENT. THE BIRTHERS ARE PART OF IT. THEY&#39;VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO  ACCEPT A BLACK MAN IN THE WHITE  HOUSE. THEN WE SEE ALL THESE DIFFERENT  MANIFESTATIONS OF IT. THAT&#39;S WHAT&#39;S GOING ON HERE. WITH ALL THESE DIFFERENT STORIES WE&#39;RE TELLING. IT&#39;S PART OF THE THE SAME M.O. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FACT  THAT CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS  WOULD SAY THAT THE PRESIDENT&#39;S A MUSLIM, HE&#39;S NOT. 16% SAID IT IN OCTOBER OF 2008. BY JULY OF 2012, THAT NUMBER HAS JUMPED TO 34%. THE EXTREME RHETORIC MAKES ITS  WAY TO AVERAGE PEOPLE WHO  BELIEVE IT. HERE&#39;S PART OF AN INTERVIEW --  LET ME SHOW YOU THIS. HERE&#39;S PART OF AN INTERVIEW THAT JONATHAN CAPEHART DID IN NORTH  CAROLINA. LISTEN TO THIS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU DON&#39;T THINK PRESIDENT  OBAMA LOVES THIS COUNTRY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOT AT ALL. NOT ONE BIT. NOT ONE BREATH THAT COMES OUT OF HIS BODY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT THE CAPTURE AND  KILLING OF OSAMA BIN LADEN? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I DON&#39;T THINK THAT EVER  HAPPENED. THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WITHIN  HIS ADMINISTRATION THAT ARE PART OF IT. THEY ARE ADMITTED MEMBERS OF THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHO EXACTLY? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I DON&#39;T REMEMBER THEIR NAMES. THEY&#39;RE NOT ENGLISH. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S THE DANGER OF ALL  THIS. ALL OF IT OUT THERE GO TO  ORDINARY AMERICANS WHO REALLY  BELIEVE THIS STUFF TO BE TRUE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY LISTEN TO EACH  OTHER. THEY DON&#39;T. THEY&#39;RE NOT CRITICAL THINKERS,  THEY DON&#39;T READ, THEY SIT  THERE -- LOOK. THEY LISTEN TO FOX. THEY LISTEN TO HANNITY. THEY LISTEN TO RUSH LIMBAUGH. THEY SIT THERE AND LISTEN TO  EACH OTHER AND THEY DON&#39;T LISTEN TO ANYBODY ELSE TO BE ABLE TO BE A CRITICAL THINKER. AND ALL OF THIS CALLING HIM  HITLER AND ALL, THIS IS WHAT IS  CALLED IN A DEBATE TRANSFERENCE. I WILL CALL YOU WHAT I AM BEFORE YOU CALL ME WHAT I REALLY KNOW I AM. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BILL? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; REVEREND AL, REAL QUICKLY I  WANT TO GET TO YOUR QUESTION  ABOUT WHO&#39;S GOING TO TELL THESE  PEOPLE. I THINK THE VOTERS OF VIRGINIA  ARE GOING TO TELL THEM TOMORROW. BECAUSE THEY HAVE THREE  CANDIDATES. GOVERNOR, LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR,  AND AN ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO ARE  ALL TEA PARTY CANDIDATES WHO ARE ALL EXTREMISTS AND ALL THREE ARE GOING TO BE REJECTED BY THE  VOTERS OF VIRGINIA TOMORROW. I THINK THAT&#39;S GOING TO SEND A  MESSAGE TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. YOU STAY WITH THESE WACKOS,  THESE EXTREME PEOPLE ON THE  FRINGE AND YOU&#39;RE GOING TO CEASE TO EXIST AS A PARTY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; FROM YOUR LIPS TO GOD&#39;S EARS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I DON&#39;T THINK ALL TEA PARTY  PEOPLE WERE EXTREMISTS. I THINK WE SEE A LOT THAT ARE  EXTREME, BUT I THINK SOME THAT  JOINED THE TEA PARTY DID SO  BECAUSE THEY HAVE GENUINE  FEELINGS THAT I MAY DISAGREE  WITH, BUT THEY WERE NOT EXTREME. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S TRUE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BUT THEY HAVEN&#39;T DONE ENOUGH  TO QUIET OR TO SEVER TIES WITH  THESE EXTREMISTS SO THEY GET  PAINTED WITH A BROAD BRUSH. AND I THINK THAT THAT IS  SOMETHING THAT THEY&#39;VE GOT TO  DEAL WITH LIKE SOME OF US THAT","media$content":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":500000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":558.825,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":240,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/u7JsJ7uyxa1n?feed=PoliticsNation","plfile$width":420,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":800000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":558.825,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":360,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/SCWRw870Bds5?feed=PoliticsNation","plfile$width":640,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":558.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":0,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/B3cjNqGKIfiT?feed=PoliticsNation","plfile$width":0,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"media$thumbnails":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"image","plfile$duration":0.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"JPEG","plfile$height":1080,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_sharp_6race_131104.jpg","plfile$width":1920,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"link":"","pubDate":1383611760000,"plmedia$defaultThumbnailUrl":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_sharp_6race_131104.jpg","nnd$associatedPlaylist":{"href":"http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_44263878"},"nnd$brand":"MSNBC","nnd$bureau":"30RockNY","nnd$bviAssetId":"n_sharp_6race_131104","nnd$canonicalUrl":{"href":"http://www.msnbc.com/politicsnation/watch/confederacy-and-todays-gop-61266499646"},"nnd$distributionProfile":["MSN-CA","AWE"],"nnd$firstAiredAtUtc":1383695069000,"nnd$lastAiredAtUtc":1383695069000,"nnd$lastEditorialChangeAtUtc":1383612274000,"nnd$longTitle":"Confederacy and today's GOP","nnd$playCount30":2157,"nnd$playCountDay":820,"nnd$playCountYear":2332,"nnd$requiresCaptioning":true,"nnd$shortDescription":"Is the GOP stuck in the past?

SECOND IN THE LINE OF SUCCESSION TO THE PRESIDENT. HE SERVED IN CONGRESS MORE THAN  30 YEARS, AND HE FOUGHT IN WORLD WAR II. BUT NOW HE HAS TO FIGHT FOR HIS  RIGHT TO VOTE.

WE NEED TO SEND BARACK OBAMA  BACK TO CHICAGO. I&#39;D LIKE TO SEND HIM BACK TO  KENYA, BACK TO INDONESIA. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE FATHER OF SENATOR TED  CRUZ RAFAEL CRUZ MAKING A  BIRTHER COMMENT AT A TEA PARTY  RALLY LAST YEAR. WE SHOWED YOU THAT VIDEO LAST  NIGHT. HIGHLIGHTING THE EXTREMISM ON  THE FAR RIGHT. EVANGELICAL WING OF THE GOP IS  WAY OVER THERE. BUT IF YOU TRY TO LOOK AT THAT  VIDEO TODAY, YOU GOT THIS  INSTEAD  INSTEAD. THE VIDEO APPARENTLY BLOCKED  FROM THE PUBLIC TO SEE. SOMEBODY DIDN&#39;T LIKE IT WE  SHOWED IT. IT&#39;S ALREADY OUT THERE. HERE&#39;S A NEWLY UNCOVERED VIDEO  THAT YOU HAVEN&#39;T SEEN YET. SHOWING RAFAEL CRUZ TALKING  ABOUT OBAMA CARE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; OBAMA CARE IS GOING TO  DESTROY THE ELDERLY BY DENYING  CARE, BY EVEN PERHAPS DENYING  TREATMENT ON PEOPLE THAT ARE IN  CATASTROPHIC SICKNESSES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; OBAMA CARE IS GOING TO  DESTROY THE ELDERLY? THIS EXTREMISM HAS BEEN FULLY  EMBRACED BY RAFAEL&#39;S SON,  SENATOR CRUZ. NEXT WEEK HE&#39;S HEADING TO SOUTH  CAROLINA TO SPEAK AT A RELIGIOUS RIGHT CONFERENCE. HE&#39;LL SHARE THE STAGE WITH  RADICAL EVANGELICALS WHO HAVE  MADE SOME STUNNING CLAIMS ABOUT  AMERICA UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA. JUST LISTEN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IN THIS ELECTION WE TIPPED  WESTERN CIVILIZATION. IT&#39;S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT. ABSOLUTELY DIFFERENT. THE CHRISTIAN VALUE SYSTEM. THE CHRISTIAN VIEW OF MAN WILL  BE REPLACED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; OBAMA&#39;S BEEN USING THE BULLY  PULPIT TO ADVANCE ISLAM. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SO HERE WE ARE, KILL 60  MILLION BABIES, RED INK AS FAR  AS THE EYE CAN SEE, HOMOSEXUALS  PRAYING AT THE INAUGURATION. IF WE GET MERCY, I THINK THE  PROCESS OF MERCY LOOKS LIKE  PROBABLY CAR BOMBS IN LOS  ANGELES, WASHINGTON, D.C., AND  DES MOINES, IOWA. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THIS STUFF IS FAR OUTSIDE THE MAINSTREAM. BUT EVERY PERSON YOU JUST HEARD  IS AN ORGANIZER OR FEATURED  SPEAKER AT THE SAME EVENT WITH  TED CRUZ. THIS PROBLEM IS MUCH BIGGER THAN THE CRUZ FAMILY. IT EXTENDS DEEP INTO THE  UNDERSIDE OF RIGHT WING  POLITICS. IT ISN&#39;T ABOUT FAITH OF  POLITICS. IT&#39;S ABOUT PARANOIA AND HATE. JOINING ME NOW IS MICHAEL KEEGAN HIS RIGHT WING WATCH BLOG TRACKS THIS EXTREMIST RED RIK. AND FRANK SCHAFFER. HE&#39;S SHORE OF THE BOOK &quot;AND GOOD SAID, BILLY.&quot; THANK YOU BOTH FOR JOINING ME. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THANKS FOR HAVING US. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THIS IS REALLY ROUGH STUFF. BUT NOT UNFAMILIAR TO YOU. WHAT IS THIS REALLY ABOUT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, LISTEN, YOU KNOW, WE&#39;VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE. YOU&#39;RE ONE OF THE ONLY IN THE  MAINSTREAM MEDIA THAT GETS IT. THE FACT IS AMERICA DOES NOT  HAVE A RIGHT WING POLITICAL  PROBLEM. AMERICA HAS A RIGHT WING  RELIGION PROBLEM. AND WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT LOSING  OUR HERITAGE AND ALL THE REST OF IT, THIS IS A KIND OF RELIGIOUS  DELUSION I TALK ABOUT IN MY BOOK &quot;AND GOD SAID, BILLY&quot; WHICH  MIGHT AS WELL BE A BIOGRAPHY OF  THE CRUZ FAMILY. WE&#39;VE GOT TO STOP BEING SO  POLITE. WE KIND OF DANCE AROUND IT AND  WE DON&#39;T SAY SOMETHING VERY  OBVIOUS. AND THAT IS THE OBAMA SABOTAGE  CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY ONE  GROUP AND ONE GROUP ONLY IN THIS COUNTRY. AND THAT IS WHITE PREDOMINANTLY  SOUTHERN EVANGELICALS WHO HAVE A CHIP ON THEIR SHOULDER BECAUSE  HE&#39;S BLACK, BECAUSE HE&#39;S  LIBERAL, BECAUSE HE&#39;S COME  PASSIONATE AND HUMANE. HE DOESN&#39;T GO ALONG WITH THEIR  WAR ON THE POOR, THEIR WAR ON  WOMEN, THEIR WAR ON GAY PEOPLE. AND THEY HAVE IT IN FOR HIM. NOT FOR POLITICAL REASONS. THEY HAVE IT IN FOR HIM BECAUSE  HE DOESN&#39;T FIT IN WITH THEIR  RIGHT WING AGENDA THAT COMES  STRAIGHT OUT OF THEIR  INTERPRETATION OF THE BIBLE. THE RELIGIOUS DELUSION I TALK  ABOUT IN THE BOOK. THAT&#39;S IT. THAT&#39;S THE STORY AND THAT&#39;S WHAT THE MEDIA HAS NOT BEEN  REPORTING. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, MICHAEL, HOW DO  THESE EXTREMISTS -- I&#39;M TALKING  ABOUT THE EVANGELICALS FRANK  WERE REFERRING TO. HOW ARE THEY CONNECTED TO THE  POLITICIANS? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, IT&#39;S INTERESTING JUST A FEW YEARS AGO A CONSERVATIVE  POLITICIAN WOULD NOT HAVE GONE  ANYWHERE NEAR ANY OF THESE CRAZY PEOPLE. NOW THEY SEEK THEM OUT. THEY GO TO THE CONFERENCES AND  YOU OFTEN FIND -- AND THAT&#39;S WHY WE TRACK IT ON RIGHT WING WATCH  IS THAT YOU OFTEN FIND THAT WHAT SOME CRAZY PERSON SAYS ON A  RADIO SHOW JUST A FEW HOURS  LATER IS COMING OUT THE MOUTHS  OF POLITICIANS. TED AND RAFAEL CRUZ ARE A GREAT  EXAMPLE. BUT THEY&#39;RE JUST THE TIP OF THE  ICEBERG. AND THEY&#39;RE ALL FLOCKING TO  THESE PEOPLE FOR THEIR ADVICE  AND THEIR COUNSEL AND TO BE SEEN WITH THEM AND PHOTOGRAPHED WITH  THEM. THEY IDENTIFY WITH THEM. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; DO THEY, FRANK, KNOW THAT  THESE PEOPLE ARE WAY OUT THERE  AND IF SO WHAT IS THE APPEAL? WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO BE OUT  WITH PEOPLE SO EXTREME? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, LOOK. THE PROBLEM THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS IS THAT A FRINGE HAS TAKEN  OVER, THE TEA PARTY. AND A FRINGE HAS TAKE B OVER  THROUGH THE TEA PARTY. IF IT WEREN&#39;T FOR THE JERRY GERRMANDERED STATES, THESE GUYS  WOULD BE A FOOTNOTE THAT WOULD  NOT SHOW UP. THEY&#39;D BE LIKE THE VILLAGE IDIOT HOWLING AT THE MOON ON THE  STREET. THE PROBLEM IS THEY&#39;VE TAKEN  OVER ONE OF OUR POLITICAL  PARTIES. AND I FAULT THE MEDIA AND THE  EVANGELICAL, QUOTE, RESPECTABLE  LEADERS LIKE BILLY GRAHAM WHOSE  SON IS ONE OF THESE RIGHT WING  CRAZY LEADERS. AND I FAULT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE  SUPPOSEDLY RESPONSIBLE FOR NOT  SPEAKING OUT. WHERE IS THE EVANGELICAL  MAINSTREAM LEADERSHIP SAYING TED CRUZ AND HIS DAD ARE NUTS. THEY DON&#39;T REPRESENT US. WHERE ARE THE PEOPLE TALKING  ABOUT THE APOCALYPTIC FANTASIES  THAT JESUS WILL COME BACK SO  HEALTH CARE REFORM, POLITICS  DOESN&#39;T MATTER ON ONE HAND. ON THE OTHER HAND THEY DON&#39;T  LIKE THE BLACK MAN IN THE WHITE  HOUSE. THEY&#39;LL DO EVERYTHING TO  SABOTAGE THEM. THERE&#39;S NO LOGIC TO WHAT THESE  PEOPLE ARE DOING. IT&#39;S ABOUT RELIGIOUS DELUSION  AND EXTREMISM. IT IS NOT ABOUT POLITICS AND THE KIND OF PEOPLE I KNEW BACK IN  THE &#39;70s AND &#39;80s WHEN I WAS  WORKING IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, I&#39;M NOT ANYMORE THANK GOD, BUT  WHEN I WAS PEOPLE LIKE JACK KEMP AND BOB DOLE WHO WERE FRIENDS OF MINE WOULD BE SHOCKED AT THESE  GUYS AND WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO  DO WITH THEM. THEY&#39;D GET PRIMARIED. THEY COULD NOT RUN IN THESE  PARTIES. THESE ARE RELIGIOUS FANATICS. THESE ARE NOT POLITICIANS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT EVANGELICALS AND TALKS ABOUT HOW FAR OUT THEY ARE, LET ME PLAY  FOR YOU AN INTERVIEW FROM AN  EVANGELICAL RADIO SHOW THAT  AIRED YESTERDAY. JUST LISTEN TO HOW THE HOST AND  GUEST TALK ABOUT PRESIDENT  OBAMA. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; OBAMA IS A LEADER OF A  MASSIVE CULT HIMSELF. HE&#39;S THE LEADER OF THE CULT AND  THE CULT IS ISLAM. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IS BARACK OBAMA LEADING  AMERICA TO A CULTURAL SUICIDE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; OH, YES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I MEAN, A CULTURAL JONESTOWN  MASSACRE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOW, THIS WAS UNCOVERED BY  YOUR RIGHT WING WATCH. THIS IS SCARY STUFF THAT&#39;S BEING PUT OUT OVER THE AIRWAVES. BUT LIKE FRANK SAYS, NO ADULTS  IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY OR ON  THE RIGHT ARE DENOUNCING THESE  KINDS OF STATEMENTS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; TO ADD WHAT FRANK WAS SAYING, I THINK THEIR STRATEGY IS  UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS WHAT  APPEALS TO VOTERS IN THE  PRIMARIES. WE&#39;RE GOING TO SEE NEXT WEEK A  GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT IN  VIRGINIA. KEN CUCCINELLI WHO IS A REAL  EXTREMIST. HE&#39;S THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR  THE TEA PARTY, GOT THE  NOMINATION FOR GOVERNOR AND NOW  WE&#39;LL SEE WHAT THE VOTERS SAY. I THINK YOU&#39;RE GOING TO FIND  PEOPLE IN VIRGINIA AND ALL  ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE SICK OF  IT. BUT IT WORKS IN THE PRIMARIES  AND DOESN&#39;T WORK IN THE GENERAL  ELECTIONS. AND THIS IS JUST THE TIP OF THE  ICEBERG. SOME OF THE STUFF YOU&#39;RE SAYING. I FEEL SORRY FOR PEOPLE THAT  HAVE TO LISTEN TO THIS ON OUR  RIGHT WING WATCH EVERY DAY. BUT EVERY DAY THERE&#39;S A CONSTANT REMINDER THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE  EXTREMISTS. SOME OF THE THINGS YOU COULDN&#39;T  EVEN BELIEVE. IT&#39;D BE FUNNY IF IT WASN&#39;T SO  SCARY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HE&#39;S RIGHT. IT IS SO MUCH OUT THERE. YESTERDAY A RIGHT WING RADIO  HOST BRIAN FISHER TWEETED THIS. WE NEED A CHRISTIAN PRESIDENT IN 2016 WHO WILL INVITE CHRISTIAN  CLERGY TO EXORCISE THE WHITE  HOUSE. AND THIS SUMMER A WEB HOST  ACTUALLY PRAYED, PRAYED TO GET  RID OF THE DEMON OF TYRANNY IN  THE WHITE HOUSE. LISTEN TO THIS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE PRAY AGAINST THE DOMESTIC  ENEMIES OF THE CONSTITUTION,  AGAINST THIS DEMON OF TYRANNY  WHO IS USING THE WHITE HOUSE  OCCUPANT. THAT DEMONIC SPIRIT IS  OPPRESSING US. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOW, THAT HOST IS ACTUALLY  RUNNING AS A REPUBLICAN IN A  SEAT FOR THE COLORADO STATE  HOUSE, FRANK. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU KNOW, REVEREND AL,  THERE&#39;S NO WAY TO OVERSTATE  THIS. ONCE YOU LET THE SPIRIT OF  RELIGIOUS FANATICISM LOSS. IF YOU DISAGREE WITH ME, YOU&#39;RE  EVIL. IT&#39;S NO LONGER POLICY. WHAT I WRITE ABOUT IS THE  TEXTBOOK THAT DESCRIBES THESE  PEOPLE. IT&#39;S DELUSION. WHAT A SHAME ON OUR COUNTRY THAT THESE REYESIST DELUSION NAR  REPUBLICANS CALLING THEMSELVES  CHRISTIANS. AND I AM A CHRISTIAN SO I RESENT PEOPLE THAT CALL THEMSELVES  CHRISTIAN THAT ARE DILUTED  RELIGIOUS RACISTS. I&#39;M TIRED OF IT. YOU&#39;RE TIRED OF IT. EVERY REASONABLE AMERICAN IS  TIRED OF IT. I JUST PRAY TO GOD THAT  GERRYMANDERING OR NOT, WE CAN  TOSS THESE PEOPLE OUT AND GET  THIS COUNTRY BACK AT LEAST TO A  SANE MIDDLE GROUND. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, WE&#39;RE GOING TO HAVE TO  KEEP EXPOSING IT. POWERFUL STUFF.","media$content":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":800000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":654.154,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":360,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/dNlEkIE74MFo?feed=PoliticsNation","plfile$width":640,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":500000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":654.154,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":240,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/9_rqP9yuFLCu?feed=PoliticsNation","plfile$width":420,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":654.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":0,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/7O5eRd81j9z5?feed=PoliticsNation","plfile$width":0,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"media$thumbnails":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"image","plfile$duration":0.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"JPEG","plfile$height":3840,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Sections/TVNews/MSNBC%20TV/PHOTOS%20-%20AMY/Sharpton/_L2A4347.JPG","plfile$width":5760,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"link":"","pubDate":1383349140000,"plmedia$defaultThumbnailUrl":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Sections/TVNews/MSNBC%20TV/PHOTOS%20-%20AMY/Sharpton/_L2A4347.JPG","nnd$associatedPlaylist":{"href":"http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_44263878"},"nnd$brand":"MSNBC","nnd$bureau":"30RockNY","nnd$bviAssetId":"n_sharp_4fringe_131101","nnd$canonicalUrl":{"href":"http://www.msnbc.com/politicsnation/watch/the-rights-problems-with-religious-extremism-59571779726"},"nnd$distributionProfile":["MSN-CA","AWE"],"nnd$firstAiredAtUtc":1383345106000,"nnd$lastAiredAtUtc":1383345106000,"nnd$lastEditorialChangeAtUtc":1383349568000,"nnd$longTitle":"The right's problems with religious extremism","nnd$playCount30":8539,"nnd$playCountDay":652,"nnd$playCountYear":8733,"nnd$requiresCaptioning":true,"nnd$shortDescription":"Frank Schaeffer and Michael Keegan join Rev.

THIS PAST JUNE 20-YEAR-OLD DAVID CONNOR COSOLANI WAS KICKED OUT  OF A CASINO FOR BEING UNDERAGE. WHAT HAPPENED NEXT WAS CAUGHT ON SURVEILLANCE TAPE. IT SHOWS POLICE OFFICERS  TACKLING DAVID TO THE GROUND AND HITTING HIM WITH THEIR CLUBS AND KNEES. THEN A K-9 DOG UNIT ROLLS UP. THE POLICE RELEASED THE DOG ON  HIM. YOU CAN SEE THE DOG BITING HIS  NECK AND DRAGGING HIM TO THE  CURB. DAVID NEEDED MORE THAN 200  STITCHES. HIS FAMILY SAYS HE SUSTAINED  PERMANENT INJURIES. THE POLICE ARE INVESTIGATING. NBC&#39;S PHILADELPHIA AFFILIATE  WCAU FIRST BROKE THE STORY AND  AN ATLANTIC CITY POLICE OFFICER  WHO WISHED TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS  TOLD INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER  HARRY HAIRSTON THAT THE COPS ARE JUST HIDING BEHIND THEIR BADGES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SOME OF THEM WOULDN&#39;T DO THIS IF THEY DIDN&#39;T HAVE A GUN AND A  BADGE. COWARDS. I JUST THINK ABOUT KIDS. SHATTERED EYE SOCKETS. DOG BITES. IT&#39;S WRONG, MAN. IT&#39;S WRONG. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; JOINING ME NOW ARE DAVID&#39;S  PARENTS DAVID AND TERRY COSOLANI AND HIS LAWYER. THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. FIRST OF ALL, DAVID, HOW IS YOUR SON? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, HE&#39;S IN SCHOOL. HE&#39;S BACK IN SCHOOL. HOWEVER, HE&#39;S NOT DOING WELL AT  ALL. IN ADDITION TO THE PHYSICAL  INJURIES, HE&#39;S SUFFERING EVERY  DAY. NIGHTMARES, ANXIETY. AND THE STRESS OF THESE FALSE  CRIMINAL CHARGES THAT HAVE BEEN  FILED AGAINST HIM. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THEY FILED CHARGES AGAINST  HIM? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CHARGING HIM WITH WHAT? GETTING BITTEN? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ACTUALLY THEY CHARGED HIM  WITH AGGRAVATED ASSAULT OF THE  POLICE OFFICERS AND ASSAULT OF  THE DOG. AGGRAVATED ASSAULT OF THIS DOG  PLUS DISORDERLY.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WAIT A MINUTE. THEY CHARGED HIM WITH ASSAULTING THE DOG? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CORRECT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE DOG THAT WE SAW ON THE  TAPE BITING HIM. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ALMOST KILLED HIM. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HE HAS TO GO TO COURT AND  TRIAL ON THIS? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YES, HE DOES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE HAVE TO PROSECUTE IT. THEY HAVE TO DO THE RIGHT THING. WE&#39;RE CONFIDENT THEY WILL. WE&#39;RE CONFIDENT HOPEFULLY THAT  THE PROSECUTOR WILL SEEK JUSTICE AGAINST THESE OFFICERS AND  CHARGE THEM. THESE ARE THE ONE WHO IS NEED TO BE CHARGED CRIMINALALLY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOW, WHEATON WHO IS THE  OFFICER INVOLVED. HE HAD COMPLAINTS AGAINST HIM  BETWEEN 2008 AND 2011. HE WAS THE SUBJECT OF 21  CIVILIAN COMPLAINTS OF  MISCONDUCT. 15 OF WHICH WERE RELATED TO  EXCESSIVE FORCE OR ASSAULT,  JENNIFER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S RIGHT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SOME OF THE COMPLAINTS WAS  BRUTALLY BEAT AND RESTRAINED. ANOTHER ALLEGES HE THREW HIM  DOWN A FLIGHT OF STAIRS AND  PUNCHED HIM. AND ANOTHER ALLEGED THE OFFICER  GRABBED, PUNCHED, AND RESTRAINED HIM AT A CASINO. ALL OF WHICH WHEATON, THE  OFFICER IN YOUR CLIENT&#39;S CASE  WAS INVOLVED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S RIGHT. ONE OF THE MOST TROUBLING  ASPECTS OF THIS CASE IS THERE IS NO INTERNAL AFFAIRS PROCESS THAT WORKS IN ATLANTIC CITY. IT IS A SHAM. THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS  INTERNAL AFFAIRS COMPLAINTS,  CIVILIAN COMPLAINTS AGAINST THIS ONE OFFICER OVER A PERIOD OF  TIME. AND NONE OF THEM, NOT ONE HAVE  BEEN SUSTAINED. HE&#39;S BEEN EXONERATED OR NOT  SUSTAINED IN EVERY ONE. AND IT&#39;S JUST NOT POSSIBLE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, DAVID, TERI, WHAT  DID YOU THINK WHIN YOU SAW THIS  VIDEO? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; COMPLETELY HORRIFIED. COMPLETELY SHOCKED. NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE THIS IN  OUR LIVES LET ALONE WITH OUR OWN SON BEING THE VICTIM OF THIS  POLICE BRUTALITY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU BROUGHT ME STILL PHOTOS  HERE. WHAT DID YOU THINK WHEN YOU SAW  YOUR SON IN THIS CONDITION AND  SAW THE VIDEO? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S AN ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE. IT&#39;S UNBELIEVABLE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU&#39;RE REGULAR CITIZENS. I MEAN, RESPECT THE POLICE. AND THERE&#39;S NO -- I MEAN, YOU  DON&#39;T LOOK TO ME TO BE ANY WIDE  EYED RADICALS LOOKING TO START  SOMETHING WITH POLICE. AND THE INJURIES ARE REAL CLEAR. HOW DO PEOPLE RECONCILE, PEOPLE  THAT YOU PAY AND YOU RESPECT TO  UPHOLD THE LAW AND YOU END UP  WITH A SITUATION LIKE THIS THAT  YOU JUST CAN&#39;T EXPLAIN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; REVEREND, I DON&#39;T KNOW HOW  YOU CAN RECONCILE IT. YOU LOOK AT THE POLICE  DEPARTMENT, POLICE OFFICERS TO  PROTECT AND SERVE. YOU DON&#39;T LOOK TO THEM TO BE  FEARFUL. YOU GO TO ATLANTIC CITY. YOU DON&#39;T WANT TO HAVE TO FEAR  THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, THE VERY  PEOPLE WHO ARE THERE TO PROTECT  YOU. I MEAN, IT&#39;S AN OUTRAGE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON IN THE COMMUNITY FOR QUITE SOME  TIME. DAVID CONNOR CASTELLANI HAS  RESOURCES. HE&#39;S A YOUNG WHITE MAN. HE&#39;S BEEN ABLE TO BRING A VOICE  TO A LOT OF THE COMMUNITY THAT  HAS BEEN TERRORIZED BY THE  POLICE DEPARTMENT FOR YEARS AND  YEARS. I HAVE BEEN CALLED -- I&#39;VE REFED SO MANY CALLS SINCE THIS  INCIDENT HAPPENED. PEOPLE FROM THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN  MARGIN ALIZE MARGINALIZED. THEY ARE THANKFUL THERE&#39;S  SOMEBODY OUT THERE TO BRING A  VOICE FOR THEM. BECAUSE NO ONE&#39;S LISTENING TO  THEM. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AN ANONYMOUS ATLANTIC CITY  POLICE OFFICER WHO CAME FORWARD  THINKS THE PROBLEM RUNS VERY  DEEP. WATCH THIS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I HONESTLY FEEL AS THOUGH IN  THE ATLANTIC CITY POLICE  DEPARTMENT THERE IS AN  UNDERCURRENT OF DISCRIMINATION,  THERE&#39;S AN UNDERCURRENT OF  THUGGISM. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; UNDERCURRENT OF  DISCRIMINATION AND THUGGISM. UNBELIEVABLE. AND THIS IS A POLICE OFFICER  SAYING THIS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S INCREDIBLE. THAT&#39;S BEEN WHAT MY EXPERIENCE  HAS BEEN. I&#39;VE BEEN RECEIVING CALLS FROM  MOTHERS, FROM VICTIMS. I HAVE ONE FELLOW I&#39;M GOING TO  BE REPRESENTING WHO HAD TWO K-9  DOGS RELEASED ON HIM. HE SAID IT FELT LIKE MOBILE,  ALABAMA, IN THE 1950s. THAT&#39;S WHAT HE FELT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK THE THING THAT IS  MOST UPSETTING TO ME, TERRI, AND I&#39;VE BEEN INVOLVED MANY YEARS IN POLICE CASES, IS THE DOGS. I MEAN, TO SICK A DOG ON YOUR  SON. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; A HELPLESS PERSON. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; A HELPLESS PERSON. HE&#39;S HANDCUFFED WHILE THE DOG IS ON HIM. THIS DOES SMACK AS SOMETHING OUT OF THE DEEP SOUTH. THEN CHARGING HIM FOR ASSAULT OF THE DOG. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I&#39;VE BEEN GETTING NUMEROUS  CALLS, NUMEROUS E-MAILS MYSELF. EVERY TIME AN ATLANTIC CITY  POLICE OFFICER BEATS SOMEONE UP, BRUTALIZES THEM, YOU SEE THE  SAME THINGS. AGGRAVATED ASSAULT AGAINST THE  POLICE OFFICER, RESISTING  ARREST, OBJECTION OF JUSTICE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; DISORDERLY CONDUCT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S THEIR M.O.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WOULD  LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN AS THE MOTHER OF THIS YOUNG MAN? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I JUST THINK OF ALL THE  MOTHERS, THAT THEIR SONS ARE OUT THERE THAT DIDN&#39;T HAVE A  VIDEOTAPE, THAT DIDN&#39;T HAVE THE  MEANS TO GET SOMEBODY TO HELP  THEM. NOW THEY&#39;RE CHARGED. THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO. THEY&#39;RE CHARGED AND THEIR LIVES  ARE OVER AND DESTROYED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; DAVID AND TERI CASTELLANI, WE ARE GOING TO BE FOLLOWING THIS","media$content":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":453.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":0,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/qmJAjikbx2Ru?feed=PoliticsNation","plfile$width":0,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":500000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":453.053,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":240,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/WNvhSRNlckjF?feed=PoliticsNation","plfile$width":420,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":800000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":453.053,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":360,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/307l5BGDjba4?feed=PoliticsNation","plfile$width":640,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"media$thumbnails":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"image","plfile$duration":0.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"JPEG","plfile$height":1080,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_sharp_5cop_131101.jpg","plfile$width":1920,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"link":"","pubDate":1383348900000,"plmedia$defaultThumbnailUrl":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_sharp_5cop_131101.jpg","nnd$associatedPlaylist":{"href":"http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_44263878"},"nnd$brand":"MSNBC","nnd$bureau":"30RockNY","nnd$bviAssetId":"n_sharp_5cop_131101","nnd$canonicalUrl":{"href":"http://www.msnbc.com/politicsnation/watch/atlantic-city-police-brutality-caught-on-tape-59571267925"},"nnd$distributionProfile":["MSN-CA","AWE"],"nnd$firstAiredAtUtc":1383346009000,"nnd$lastAiredAtUtc":1383346009000,"nnd$lastEditorialChangeAtUtc":1383349205000,"nnd$longTitle":"Atlantic City police brutality caught on tape","nnd$playCount30":9398,"nnd$playCountDay":722,"nnd$playCountYear":9620,"nnd$requiresCaptioning":true,"nnd$shortDescription":"Rev.

BUT LET&#39;S BE CLEAR. ALL THIS GLITCH HUNT HEARINGS ON CAPITOL HILL WERE A SHAM, AN  ACT. THERE HAS BEEN AN OBAMA CARE  SABOTAGE CAMPAIGN FROM DAY ONE. POLITICO WRITES THE OPPOSITION  WAS STRATEGIC FROM THE START. DERAIL PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA&#39;S  BIGGEST AMBITION AND DERAIL  OBAMA HIMSELF. THAT&#39;S WHAT THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT. DERAILING THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF. AND LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE WITH  THIS PRESIDENT, THE RIGHT WING  ISN&#39;T ATTACKING ON SUBSTANCE. IT&#39;S ATTACKING OUT OF HATRED FOR THE PRESIDENT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES THAT  HIS VISION FOR AMERICA INCLUDING HEALTH CARE FOR ALL IS MORE  NOBLE THAN ANY TRUTHFUL  STATEMENT. AND SO HE JUSTIFIES HIS ACTIONS  EVEN IF DECEIT IS INVOLVED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; DECEIT? THE PRESIDENT WAS TRYING TO  DECEIVE AMERICA BY FIGHTING FOR  AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE? AND HERE&#39;S RUSH LIMBAUGH TODAY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; RICHARD NIXON RESIGNED OVER A LIE NOWHERE NEAR THIS BIG. AND YOU KNOW THE HELL OF IT IS  OBAMA DOESN&#39;T THINK HE LIED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; COMPARING A HEALTH CARE  ROLLOUT TO WATERGATE? THAT&#39;S A JOKE. JUST LIKE THE GOP&#39;S PHONY  INTEREST IN AFFORDABLE HEALTH  CARE. JOINING ME NOW IS CONGRESSMAN  JIM McDERMOTT, DEMOCRAT FROM  WASHINGTON. THANKS FOR COMING ON THE SHOW  TONIGHT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; GOOD TO SEE YOU, AL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CONGRESSMAN, SABOTAGING,  RELENTLESS ATTACKS ON THIS  PRESIDENT. WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AL, YOU KNOW, THEY STARTED  FROM THE DAY AFTER THE ELECTION. I MEAN, OBAMA WAS JUST ELECTED  BY A HUGE MAJORITY AND THEY  DIDN&#39;T TAKE IT. THEY DIDN&#39;T THINK IT MEANT  ANYTHING. THEY STARTED IMMEDIATELY TO DO  SO NOTHING AND FOR THE LAST YEAR THEY HAVE DONE ABSOLUTELY  NOTHING TO MAKE THE OBAMA CARE  WORK WITH ANY HELP FROM THE  REPUBLICANS. ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED CAME OUT  OF THE WHITE HOUSE OR OUT OF THE SENATE. AND THE REPUBLICANS HAVE DONE  NOTHING BUT DRAG THEIR FEET. THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF THINGS  THEY COULD HAVE DONE TO MAKE IT  WORK BETTER. GOVERNORS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY  SAT ON THEIR HANDS. LEGISLATURES, REFORMS,  EXCHANGES, EVERYTHING POSSIBLE  WAS DONE TO MAKE IT FAIL. AND RIGHT UP UNTIL THE VERY LAST MINUTE, THEY SHUT THE GOVERNMENT DOWN TO THEY COULD HAVE THE  FINAL ACT WITH COMING ONLINE  WITH THE PROGRAM THAT GOVERNMENT WOULDN&#39;T BE FUNCTIONING. IT WAS A MASSIVE PROPAGANDA  STUNT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOW, TODAY SENATOR TED CRUZ  ARGUED THAT THE AFFORDABLE CARE  ACT HURTS THE POOR. LISTEN TO THIS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA RIGHT  NOW, THE TOP 1% EARN A HIGHER  SHARE OF U.S. INCOME THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE 1928. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING HURT  UNDER THE OBAMA ECONOMY ARE  YOUNG PEOPLE, ARE HISPANICS,  AFRICAN-AMERICANS, SINGLE MOMS. THOSE WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO  CLIMB THE ECONOMIC LADDER. THOSE ARE THE ONES LOSING THEIR  HEALTH CARE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOW, HOW IS SENATOR CRUZ  WHO&#39;S GETTING HIS OWN HEALTH  INSURANCE FROM GOLDMAN SACHS  ACTING LIKE A POPULIST? I MEAN, HOW IS THIS GO TO WASH? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT SIMPLY ISN&#39;T GOING TO FLY. THE PEOPLE WILL SEE THROUGH IT. HE&#39;S SAYING THAT THERE ARE  PEOPLE WHO DON&#39;T HAVE HEALTH  CARE AND HE STARTS CRYING. IF THOSE AREN&#39;T CROCODILE TEARS, I DON&#39;T KNOW WHAT ARE. THIS GUY HAS NO FEELING FOR  THOSE PEOPLE OR HE WOULD HAVE  STOPPED HIS EFFORT TO DESTROY IT AND MAKE IT WORK. I TALKED TO BILL FRIST SOME  MONTHS AGO. HE WAS A FORMER LEADER OF THE  REPUBLICANS. HE SAID, JIM, WE SHOULD STOP  TRYING TO REPEAL IT AND FIX IT. MAKE IT WORK. BUT CRUZ HAS NONE OF THAT IN HIM AT ALL. IT&#39;S ALL CROCODILE TEARS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND THERE&#39;S THIS RELENTLESS  ATTACK OF MISINFORMATION ABOUT  THE LAW BY THE RIGHT WING MEDIA. WATCH THIS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THERE&#39;S TOO MUCH HEALTH  INSURANCE. IT COVERS TOO MUCH. TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVE IT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE GOVERNMENT DECIDING WHO  WILL LIVE, WHO WILL DIE. YOU&#39;RE TOO OLD, YOU&#39;RE TOO  YOUNG. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IS THAT WHAT THIS PLAN IS  ABOUT BY SAVING MONEY BY TELLING WHO TO KILL PEOPLE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; PUTTING YOU AT RISK OF LOSING INSURANCE IS A BIT OF HOT AIR,  IN MY OPINION. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S NOT INSURANCE. IT&#39;S WELFARE. BUY YOUR OWN BIRTH CONTROL PILL. BUY YOUR OWN BREAST PUMP. THAT&#39;S NOT A HEALTH ISSUE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S AMAZING. AND THEY TRY TO PRETEND THAT  THEY WANT TO MAKE THE HEALTH  CARE -- AFFORDABLE CARE ACT  WORK. DO THEY THINK WE FORGOT THEY  TRIED TO REPEAL IT 46 TIMES? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; EVERY TIME WE TURNED AROUND  IN THE CONGRESS IN THE LAST  YEAR, THEY WERE BRINGING ANOTHER FORWARD TO REPEAL OBAMA CARE. THEY SIMPLY DO NOT CARE ABOUT  PEOPLE. THIS IS REALLY A WAR ON THE  POOR. AND THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS  THAT IS THE MOST DIFFICULT FOR  THE PEOPLE AT THE LOWER END OF  THE ECONOMIC SCHEDULE TO DEAL  WITH. THAT IS AN ILLNESS OR AN INJURY. YOU COULD BE WIPED OUT FOR THE  REST OF YOUR LIFE. IT&#39;S WHY IT&#39;S THE NUMBER ONE  CAUSE OF BANKRUPTCY. AND THEY DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. THEY SAY, OH, WELL, WE SHOULD  REPEAL IT. AND DO WHAT? THEY HAVE NEVER PUT ANYTHING ON  THE TABLE TO REPLACE IT.

AND THANKS TO YOU FOR TUNING IN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt;&gt; TONIGHT&#39;S LEAD, AMERICANS  FEEL THE AX. REPUBLICANS TURN THEIR BACKS. TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN  HISTORY, EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN  WHO RECEIVES FOOD STAMPS ARE  SEEING THEIR BENEFITS REDUCED. BECAUSE FUNDING FROM A 2009  MEASURE IS RUNNING OUT. 47 MILLION AMERICANS WHO GET  THESE BENEFITS ARE FEELING THE  PAIN TODAY. IT&#39;S HAPPENING ALL OVER THE  COUNTRY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY VITAL PARTICULARLY FOR AN AREA LIKE OURS AND THE  ECONOMIC SITUATION WE&#39;RE IN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I DON&#39;T LOOK AT IT AS A  DOLLAR AMOUNT I&#39;M LOSING, I&#39;M  LOOKING AT IT AS TWO GALLONS OF  MILK, COUPLE LOAVES OF BREAD. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT HELPS A LOT. LIKE, TREMENDOUSLY. USUALLY JUST ABOUT TAKES US  THROUGH THE MONTH. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE DEFINITELY NEED IT. WE DEFINITELY USE IT ALL. YOU KNOW, WE -- YOU KNOW, WE  HAVE TO EAT. WE&#39;RE NOT EATING BETTER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THESE ARE PEOPLE FROM ALL  WALKS OF LIFE. ABOUT 21 MILLION CHILDREN LIVE  IN HOUSEHOLDS THAT COUNT ON FOOD STAMPS. 900,000 MILITARY VETERANS COUNT  ON FOOD STAMPS. THAT&#39;S A GROUP REPUBLICANS NEVER TIRE OF PRETENDING THEY CARE  ABOUT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CAN&#39;T WE ALL COME TOGETHER IN A BIPARTISAN MATTER AND SAY WE  SUPPORT OUR VETERANS? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE  ACTION TO SUPPORT OUR VETERANS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; PROTECT AND HONOR AMERICA&#39;S  BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; PROTECT AND HONOR THE BRAVE. REPUBLICANS CAN START BY NOT  TURNING BACK THEIR BACKS ON  VETERANS. AND THAT&#39;S EXACTLY WHAT THEY&#39;RE  DOING. WHERE ARE THEY TODAY? GONE. INSTEAD OF TRYING TO FIX THE  PROBLEM, HOUSE REPUBLICANS WHO  SET THE LEGISLATIVE CALENDAR ARE TAKING A BREAK. THEY&#39;LL BE OFF ALL NEXT WEEK. WHILE 47 MILLION AMERICANS  SUFFER, THEY&#39;LL BE ON VACATION. THEY&#39;LL FOCUS ON SLASHING $40  BILLION MORE FROM FOOD STAMPS  WHEN BACK TO WORK. THINK ABOUT THOSE PRIORITIES. THEY WANT TO TAKE FOOD AWAY FROM CHILDREN AND GIVE BREAKS TO WALL STREET. BUT THIS ISN&#39;T JUST ABOUT FOOD  STAMPS. IT&#39;S PAUL RYAN BACK WITH HIS OLD PLAN TO CUT SOCIAL SECURITY AND  MEDICARE. IT&#39;S REPUBLICAN SENATOR TOM  COBURN PRAISE THE DEVASTATING  BUDGET CUTS THAT HIT HEAD START  AND OTHER VITAL PROGRAMS. IT&#39;S ABOUT A PHILOSOPHY THAT  SAYS IF YOU&#39;RE DOWN ON YOUR  LUCK, THEN YOU&#39;RE OUT OF LUCK. IN THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE  WORLD. AND THE RICHEST COUNTRY IN THE  WORLD FOR A POLITICAL PARTY TO  GOVERN LIKE THIS IS A SHAME. JOINING ME NOW IS CONGRESSWOMAN  KAREN BASS AND &quot;WASHINGTON POST&quot; E.J. DIONNE. GOOD TO SEE YOU. CONGRESSWOMAN, 47 MILLION  AMERICANS SUFFERING TODAY, AND  YOUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES WANT  TO SLASH 40 BILLION MORE. HOW DO YOU FIGHT THIS? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? I&#39;M HAPPY TO SAY THAT THERE IS  GOING TO BE A COMMITTEE OF BOTH  THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE THAT&#39;S  GOING TO BE MEETING WHILE WE&#39;RE  ON BREAK. AND HOPEFULLY THEY WILL COME TO  SOME RESOLUTION. IT&#39;S WORSE THAN JUST PROTECTING  WALL STREET. YOU REMEMBER, REV, THAT WHEN  THIS WAS VOTED ON, SOME OF THE  SAME REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF THE  HOUSE VOTED FOR THEMSELVES TO  HAVE FARM SUBSIDIES TO THE TUNE  OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. I THINK IT IS TRAGIC THAT THE  HOUSE WANTS TO CUT $40 BILLION  MORE. NOW, ONE THING I&#39;M COMFORTED BY  IS I KNOW THAT WILL NEVER GET  THROUGH THE SENATE. SO DURING THIS CONFERENCE  COMMITTEE, I HOPE THEY COME TO A RESOLUTION. IN MY OPINION, THEY SHOULDN&#39;T BE MAKING CUTS TO FOOD STAMPS AT  ALL. BUT $40 BILLION IS RIDICULOUS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, E.J., RUSH LIMBAUGH THE REAL HEAD OF THE REPUBLICAN  PARTY, HE REALLY SHOWS THE  MENTALITY OF SO MANY ON THE  RIGHT. HERE HE IS TODAY ON FOOD STAMPS. LISTEN TO THIS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S AS THOUGH THESE PEOPLE  CAN&#39;T EVEN PROVIDE AN M &amp; M FOR  THEMSELVES. THE IDEA WITHOUT FOOD STAMPS  PEOPLE ARE GOING TO STARVE. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GO WITHOUT  21 MEALS THIS MONTH BECAUSE THEY HAVE A $36 CUT IN THEIR FOOD  STAMP ALLOTMENT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOW, YOU KNOW E.J., LIMBAUGH  CAN&#39;T IMAGINE THAT $36 WOULD CUT 21 MEALS. BUT HERE&#39;S THE REALITY. ON AVERAGE S.N.A.P. BENEFITS PAY FOR $1.40 PER MEAL. THAT&#39;S IT. SO A $36 REDUCTION WOULD MEAN  LOSING ABOUT 25 MEALS. DO THE MATH. SO, YES, RUSH. $1.40 A MEAL, TRY LIVING ON  THAT. WHY DO SO MANY ON THE RIGHT  DEMONIZE PEOPLE WHO ARE POOR,  E.J.? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; DID YOU NOTICE THAT TERM  &quot;THESE PEOPLE.&quot; WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY &quot;THESE  PEOPLE&quot;? THESE PEOPLE INCLUDE A WHOLE LOT OF AMERICANS WHO WORK REALLY  HARD FOR A LIVING. IF YOU WANT TO CUT FOOD STAMPS,  THE BEST WAY TO DO IT IS RAISE  THE MINIMUM WAGE SO PEOPLE WOULD HAVE MORE TAKE-HOME PAY IN THEIR POCKETS. THE AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD GETS $281  A YEAR IN FOOD STAMPS. THAT&#39;S LESS THAN $3400 A YEAR. THE AVERAGE INDIVIDUAL GETS $133 A YEAR. THAT&#39;S LESS THAN $1600 A YEAR. DOES LIMBAUGH REALLY THINK THIS  IS ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY? HE GETS A LOT MORE THAN THAT, I  BET, IF HE HAS A MORTGAGE  DEDUCTION. THIS IS NOT A VERY GENEROUS  PROGRAM. IT&#39;S JUST HELPING PEOPLE GET BY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, CONGRESSWOMAN, THE  ISSUE IS REALLY BIGGER THAN JUST FOOD STAMPS. LOOK AT THE PRIORITIES OF THE  REPUBLICANS. THEY REALLY HAVEN&#39;T CHANGED. THEY&#39;RE FIGHTING TO CUT SOCIAL  SECURITY AND MEDICAID. THEY WANT MORE MEANS TESTING FOR MEDICARE. THEY LOVE TO KEEP THE SEQUESTER  CUTS WHICH HIT THINGS LIKE HEAD  START AND MEALS ON WHEELS. AND ON THE FLIP SIDE, THEY WANT  LOWER TAXES FOR THE RICH,  SUBSIDIES FOR ALL COMPANIES, AND THEY WANT TO GUT WALL STREET  REFORM. THESE ARE SOME REAL WEIRD  PRIORITIES FOR PEOPLE THAT CLAIM THEY LOVE AMERICA AND LOVE THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND DON&#39;T FORGET TO ADD IN  THAT THEY DON&#39;T WANT PEOPLE TO  HAVE HEALTH CARE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S NEAR THE TOP OF THE  LIST.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; EXACTLY. I DO THINK IT&#39;S SAD. BUT IT REALLY DOES REFLECT AN  UNDERLYING PHILOSOPHY. AND THAT IS THE SURVIVAL OF THE  FITTEST. AND SO WE DON&#39;T WANT TO PUT A  HAND OUT TO HELP FOLKS. IF YOU CAN&#39;T MAKE IT, THEN  YOU&#39;RE OUT OF LUCK. BUT WHEN WE&#39;RE TALKING ABOUT  FOOD STAMPS JUST LIKE YOU SHOWED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEGMENT  IS THERE&#39;S A LOT OF VETERANS ON  FOOD STAMPS. ARE THEY SAYING THAT THEY&#39;RE  JUST SITTING AROUND WAITING TO  HAVE A GOVERNMENT HANDOUT? I THINK IT&#39;S A REAL DOUBLE  STANDARD. AND IT&#39;S A VERY SAD WAY THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS DEVELOPED. YOU KNOW, IN ADDITION TO  CUTTING, THEY ALSO WANT TO ADD  ON CRAZY RESTRICTIONS LIKE YOU  HAVE TO HAVE DRUG TESTING AND  YOU HAVE TO WORK IGNORING THE  FACT THAT A HUGE PERCENTAGE IF  NOT THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO  ARE ON FOOD STAMP DOS WORK. THEY JUST DON&#39;T MAKE ENOUGH OF A LIVING TO FEED THEMSELVES  COMPLETELY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND IT IS THAT ATTITUDE,  E.J., IT IS THE DISDAIN FOR  PEOPLE THAT IS REALLY, REALLY  TROUBLING TO ME. IT&#39;S ONE THING TO DEAL WITH  POLICY, BUT IT&#39;S A DISDAIN FOR  LOW INCOME AMERICANS THAT COME  FROM ALL OF THE PUNDITS AND  SPEAKERS FOR THE RIGHT. LISTEN TO THIS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SELF RELIANCE MEANS IF ANYONE SHALL NOT WORK, NEITHER SHALL HE EAT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; REALLY POOR CHILDREN IN POOR  NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE NO HABITS OF  WORKING AND HAVE NOBODY AROUND  THEM WHO WORKS. THEY HAVE NO HABIT OF I DO THIS  AND YOU GIVE ME CASH. UNLESS IT&#39;S ILLEGAL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; TEACH A MAN HOW TO FISH, HE  CAN FEED HIMSELF FOR A LIFE. DON&#39;T SIMPLY FEED FISH. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; EVERYBODY OUT OF WORK IS  EATING. THEY&#39;VE GOT BIG SCREEN TV,  PROBABLY HAVE A CAR, PROBABLY  HAVE A CELL PHONE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; MY CONTENTION IS THAT THE  OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS  ENCOURAGING PARASITES TO COME  OUT AND, YOU KNOW, TAKE AS MUCH  AS THEY CAN WITH NO REMORSE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOW, WE CAN DEBATE ECONOMIC  POLICY. WE CAN DEBATE HOW YOU AID THOSE  LOW INCOME AMERICANS. BUT THE DISDAIN, THE ALMOST  DEMONIZING AND DENIGRATING OF  PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC  STATUS, THAT TO ME IS  INEXCUSABLE, E.J. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK SO TOO. THEY&#39;RE ACTING AS IF ALL THESE  FOLKS HAVE MANSIONS RIGHT NEXT  DOOR TO DONALD TRUMP ON PUBLIC  BENEFITS. THEY ACT AS IF ALL THESE FOLKS  DON&#39;T WANT TO WORK. ONE OF THE INSIDIOUS THINGS IN  THE HOUSE BILL IS THAT THEY SAY  THEY HAVE A WORK REQUIREMENT. BUT THAT&#39;S NOT A REAL WORK  REQUIREMENT, BECAUSE STATES CAN  CUT PEOPLE EVEN IF THEY&#39;RE  UNEMPLOYED, EVEN IF THEY&#39;RE  LOOKING FOR WORK, EVEN IF THEY  CAN&#39;T FIND JOBS THAT THEY WANT  TO TAKE. AND THE STATE IS UNDER NO  OBLIGATION TO HELP THEM. THAT&#39;S NOT A WORK REQUIREMENT. THAT&#39;S JUST PUNISHING PEOPLE  BECAUSE THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS HIGH. AND SO IT&#39;S CRAZY TO TALK THIS  WAY ABOUT OUR FELLOW CITIZENS  AND I AGREE WITH YOU. I THINK IT&#39;S WRONG. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CONGRESSWOMAN, BUT THERE IS  SOME GOOD NEWS IN ALL OF THIS. BECAUSE SOME REPUBLICANS MIGHT  BE SEEING REALITY. SOME ARE SLAMMING THIS WAR  AGAINST THE POOR. THE PRESIDENT OF A MAJOR  CONSERVATIVE THINK TANK SAYS,  QUOTE, ONE OF THE THINGS IN MY  VIEW THAT WE GET WRONG IS THIS  WAR AGAINST THE SOCIAL SAFETY  NET WHICH IS JUST INSANE. AND EARLIER THIS WEEK GOP  GOVERNOR KASICH SAID, QUOTE, I&#39;M CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THERE  SEEMS TO BE A WAR ON THE POOR. SO THERE SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE  CRACK OF LIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF  THIS WALL THAT SEEMS INFLEXIBLE  AGAINST WORKING CLASS PEOPLE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, I DO THINK THAT  THAT&#39;S A HOPEFUL SIGN. AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE NEED  THE REPUBLICANS TO TAKE THEIR  PARTY BACK AWAY FROM THE  EXTREMIS EXTREMISTS. AND IT&#39;S ALSO PART OF THE  REALITY. THE SAD THING IS IT&#39;S NOT LIKE  THERE&#39;S NOT POOR PEOPLE IN THEIR DISTRICTS. BECAUSE EACH ONE OF THE  REPUBLICANS THAT VOTE THIS WAY  AROUND FOOD STAMPS THAT WANT TO  DO THESE DEVASTATING CUTS, THEY  HAVE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF POOR  PEOPLE IN THEIR DISTRICT. NOW, IT PUTS THE --  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; MANY OF WHOM WORK EVERY DAY. MANY ARE WORKING PEOPLE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND THEY&#39;RE ALSO PEOPLE WE  NEED TO GO OUT AND REGISTER SO  WE CAN CORRECT THIS NEXT  NOVEMBER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CONGRESSWOMAN KAREN BASS, I&#39;M GOING TO HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE.

TONIGHT&#39;S LEAD, LIKE FATHER LIKE SON. WE&#39;VE COME TO EXPECT EXTREME  TALK FROM TEXAS SENATOR TED  CRUZ. AND NOW WE SEE THE APPLE DOESN&#39;T FALL FAR FROM THE TREE. MOTHER JONES HAS UNCOVERED NEW  VIDEO OF THE SENATOR&#39;S FATHER  RAFAEL CRUZ. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE HAVE OUR WORK CUT OUT FOR  US. WE NEED TO SEND BARACK OBAMA  BACK TO CHICAGO. SEND HIM BACK TO KENYA. [ APPLAUSE ] &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SEND HIM BACK TO KENYA? THIS WASN&#39;T A ONE-TIME JOKE. SENATOR CRUZ&#39;S FATHER HAS SAID  SIMILAR THINGS PLENTY OF TIMES. OFTEN AT TEA PARTY EVENTS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHEN OBAMA CAMPAIGNED IN  2008, IT WAS VERY CLEAR HE WAS A SOCIALIST. ONE OF THE THINGS IN OBAMA CARE  IS THAT FOR THE ELDERLY, EVERY  FIVE YEARS YOU MUST HAVE END OF  LIFE COUNSELING. TRANSLATION, SUICIDE COUNSELING. NOT MUCH DIFFERENT THAN THAT  FRIEND THAT LEFT BEHIND IN CUBA. GOVERNING JUST LIKE A DICTATOR  LIKE FIDEL CASTRO. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THIS IS VILE STUFF. SO WHY SHOULD ANYONE CARE WHAT A SENATOR&#39;S FATHER SAYS OR THINKS? BECAUSE RAFAEL CRUZ HIMSELF IS A RISING STAR IN THE GOP. A TEA PARTY HERO WHO IS A PRIME  EXAMPLE OF HOW EXTREME AND  HATEFUL TOWARDS PRESIDENT OBAMA  THE RIGHT WING HAS BECOME. HE DOES JOINT INTERVIEWS WITH  HIS SON. THEY SPEAK AT THE SAME  ANTI-OBAMA CARE EVENTS. THEY GET THE SAME ADORING  TREATMENT FROM RIGHT WING  TALKERS. AND THE SENIOR MR. CRUZ EVEN  GETS SHOUTOUTS FROM OTHER FAR  RIGHT SENATORS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BY THE WAY, I SEE MY FRIEND  RAFAEL CRUZ HERE THIS MORNING. THANK YOU, SIR, FOR SENDING A  GREAT SON TO WASHINGTON. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; RAFAEL CRUZ DOES A LOT MORE  THAN JUST FOLLOW HIS SON&#39;S  CAREER. THE CONSERVATIVE NATIONAL REVIEW SAYS HE IS, QUOTE, NOT MERELY A  CONFIDANT AND A STAND-IN, BUT A  SPECIAL ENVOY. SENATOR CRUZ USES HIS FATHER FOR THE KIND OF GUIDANCE YOU&#39;D  EXPECT FROM A CONSULTANT. THE FACT IS THE FRINGE ELEMENTS  OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AREN&#39;T  FRINGE ANYMORE. INCREASINGLY THE EXTREME IS  BECOMING MAINSTREAM. THAT&#39;S WHY WE SAW SENATOR CRUZ  AND SARAH PALIN SPEAKING AT THE  SAME RALLY AS THIS GUY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE ARE NOW RULED, QUOTE  UNQUOTE, BY A PRESIDENT WHO BOWS DOWN TO ALLAH. DEMAND THAT THIS PRESIDENT LEAVE TOWN, TO GET OUT, TO PUT THE  KORAN DOWN, TO GET UP OFF HIS  KNEES, AND TO FIGURATIVELY COME  UP WITH HIS HANDS OUT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THIS WAS A RALLY WHERE A MAN  WAVED A CONFEDERATE FLAG OUTSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE. THIS IS A PARTY THAT WELCOMES  CANDIDATES LIKE CHRIS McDANIEL. HE&#39;S THE MISSISSIPPI REPUBLICAN  RUNNING FOR SENATE WHO&#39;S WON  ENDORSEMENTS FROM TEA PARTY  GROUPS LIKE FREEDOM WORKS AND  SENATE CONSERVATIVES FUND. EARLIER THIS SUMMER, MR.  McDANIELS SPOKE AT A CONFERENCE  PUT ON BY A NEO-CONFEDERATE  GROUP. AND TODAY&#39;S REPUBLICAN PARTY,  THAT&#39;S NOT A PROBLEM. THE EXTREME ELEMENTS AREN&#39;T  FRINGE ANYMORE. THEY&#39;RE FRONT AND CENTER FOR THE WHOLE PARTY AND THE WHOLE WORLD  TO SEE. IT&#39;S ALL IN THE FAMILY. GOP STYLE. JOINING ME NOW ARE KRYSTAL BALL  AND ED RENDELL. THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THANKS FOR HAVING US, REV. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; MY PLEASURE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; GOVERNOR, SENATOR CRUZ IS  BACKING AWAY FROM THIS VIDEO. HIS OFFICE SAYS THESE SELECTIVE  QUOTES TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT,  MISCHARACTERIZE THE SUBSTANCE OF PASTOR CRUZ&#39;S MESSAGE. PASTER CRUZ DOES NOT SPEAK FOR  THE SENATOR. BUT CALLING THE PRESIDENT A  SOCIALIST, A DICTATOR. YOU KNOW, JOKING ABOUT KENYA. DOES THE SENATOR HAVE TO DO MORE TO ADDRESS THIS AND THESE  STATEMENTS BY HIS FATHER? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SURE HE DOES. THIS IS NOT BILLY CARTER WHO  NEVER DID ANYTHING, WAS NEVER  ALLOWED TO CAMPAIGN FOR JIMMY  CARTER. JIMMY CARTER COULDN&#39;T CONTROL  BILLY CARTER. BUT TED CRUZ USES HIS FATHER AS  A CAMPAIGNER. HE IS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR  WHAT HIS FATHER SAYS. THOSE QUOTES ARE NOT TAKEN OUT  OF CONTEXT. IF YOU READ THE ENTIRE  TRANSCRIPT OF THESE THINGS, IT  GETS EVEN WORSE. HE SAYS THINGS LIKE THIS IS A  CHRISTIAN NATION AND THE  CONSTITUTION SAYS IT&#39;S A  CHRISTIAN NATION. WELL, READ IT AGAIN, PASTOR  CRUZ. THE CONSTITUTION SAYS WE  ESTABLISH NO RELIGION. AND HERE WE ARE JEWS AND HINDUS  AND MUSLIMS, AND ALL TYPES OF  RELIGION. AND HE SAYS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY PROMOTES WHAT&#39;S CONTRARY TO THE  WORD OF GOD. THE WORD OF GOD TELLS US TO HEAL THE SICK, TO FEED THE HUNGRY, TO TEACH THE CHILDREN WELL. THOSE ARE PRINCIPLES THE  DEMOCRATIC PARTY BELIEVES IN AND PUTS MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS  BEHIND. I TAKE OFFENSE AT A LOT OF WHAT  HE SAYS. AND TED CRUZ OUGHT TO GET TO THE BUSINESS OF DISAVOWING HIS  FATHER. STOP USING HIM AS A SURROGATE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THIS IS AN EXAMPLE, KRYSTAL  OF HOW EXTREME HAS GONE  MAINSTREAM IN THE REPUBLICAN  PARTY. THAT&#39;S REALLY WHAT&#39;S TROUBLING  HERE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YEAH. I THINK THAT&#39;S EXACTLY RIGHT. WHEN HE DELIVERS A LINE LIKE  SEND THE PRESIDENT BACK TO  KENYA, IT&#39;S A HUGE APPLAUSE  LINE. IT&#39;S NOT LIKE HE&#39;S OUT THERE ON  HIS OWN AND NO ONE&#39;S SUPPORTING  HIM. AS YOU POINTED OUT, THIS GUY HAS BECOME A TEA PARTY DARLING. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND HOW DO YOU TAKE THAT OUT  OF CONTEXT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SEEMS LIKE THAT WAS PRETTY  MUCH WHAT HE MEANT IN THAT  MOMENT. AND SO I THINK HE IS SORT OF THE PERFECT EMBODIMENT OF WHAT THE  TEA PARTY ACTUALLY BELIEVES. AND ONE PIECE OF THIS THAT&#39;S  INTERESTING IS WHEN THE TEA  PARTY FIRST CAME INTO BEING IN  2009 AS A BACKLASH AGAINST THIS  PRESIDENT, THEIR WHOLE LINE WAS  WE ARE JUST CONCERNED ABOUT  ECONOMIC ISSUES. WE DON&#39;T CARE ABOUT THE SOCIAL  ISSUES. WE&#39;RE JUST CONCERNED ABOUT  ECONOMIC ISSUES. IN TRUTH, THEY&#39;VE BEEN VERY  CONCERNED WITH THE SOCIAL ISSUES AND THEY&#39;VE BEEN FAR RIGHT IN  TERMS OF THEIR RELIGIOUS  BELIEVES AS WELL. RAFAEL CRUZ REPRESENTS THAT  MELDING OF THESE EXTREME RIGHT  WING POPULISM AND THE RELIGIOUS  RIGHT. HE PERFECTLY VOICES WHAT IS  GOING ON WITH THAT STRAND OF  AMERICAN POLITICS. AND TED CRUZ IS EXPLOITING IT  FOR HIS BENEFIT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND HE&#39;S ON IMPORTANT FACTOR. YOU KNOW, GOVERNOR, IN CASE WE  WEREN&#39;T SURE HOW IMPORTANT HE  WAS, LISTEN TO RUSH LIMBAUGH,  WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT SENATOR  CRUZ&#39;S FATHER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; TED CRUZ, THE SENATOR FROM  TEXAS, IS A GREAT CONSERVATIVE. HE IS A -- HE&#39;S A GOOD SPEAKER. HE&#39;S A GOOD ORATOR. IT TURNS OUT HE GETS IT FROM HIS DAD. THIS GUY KNOCKING IT OUT OF THE  PARK. RAFAEL CRUZ, THE FATHER OF TED  CRUZ. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I MEAN, THAT&#39;S BASICALLY A  RIGHT WING SEAL OF APPROVAL FROM THE HEAD OF THE REPUBLICAN  PARTY, RUSH LIMBAUGH. BUT IT&#39;S NOT JUST RAFAEL AND TED CRUZ. ALL OF THE EXTREMISM HAS MADE  ITS WAY TO THE HALLS OF  CONGRESS. BECAUSE MEMBERS OPENLY MAKE  BIRTHER COMMENTS LIKE THIS. WATCH THIS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I DON&#39;T KNOW WHETHER BARACK  OBAMA WAS BORN IN THE UNITED  STATES OR NOT. I DON&#39;T KNOW THAT. BUT I DO KNOW THIS. THAT IN NIZ HEART HE&#39;S NOT  AMERICAN. HE&#39;S JUST NOT AN AMERICAN.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ALL KI TELL YOU IS THAT THE  GENERAL CONSENSUS IS THAT HE HAS PRODUCED A BIRTH CERTIFICATE. QUESTION IS, IS IT LEGITIMATE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I MEAN, IF SOMEONE ASKED FOR  MY BIRTH CERTIFICATE, I&#39;D GO AND GET IT OUT AND SAY HERE IT IS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SO ALL OF THESE OUTRAGEOUS  STATEMENTS, GOVERNOR, BY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. I MEAN, AGAIN THE EXTREME GOING  MAINSTREAM IN THE REPUBLICAN  PARTY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SURE. THESE AREN&#39;T CITIZENS WHO GO TO  A RALLY AND SAY SOMETHING. THESE ARE ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO  BEAR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY ACROSS THEIR CHEST. IT&#39;S ALARMING IN ONE SENSE, BUT  ALSO HEARTENING IN ANOTHER  SENSE. BECAUSE THE MORE THEY RATCHET UP THIS RHETORIC, THE MORE THIS  HATE AND DIVISIVENESS SPEWS OUT, THE MORE IT&#39;S GOING TO DRAW OUT  MODERATE REPUBLICAN VOTERS AWAY  FROM THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND  ITS CANDIDATES. IT&#39;S A TERRIBLY DAMAGING THING  FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO HAVE SOMEONE OUT THERE SAYING WE&#39;RE A CHRISTIAN NATION. MICHIGAN HAS A LARGE NUMBER OF  VOTING AMERICANS. YOU WANT TO OFFEND THEM. YOU WANT TO OFFEND JEWISH  VOTERS? IT&#39;S MAKES NO SENSE. WHEN THEY HEAR THIS STUFF AND  IT&#39;S NOT DISAVOWED, THAT WAS THE POINT YOU MADE AT THE BEGINNING. IF TED CRUZ WAS SMART, HE WOULD  DISAVOW HIS DAD IN AS KIND OF  WORDS AS HE CAN. BUT HE WOULD SAY, LOOK. THE PRESIDENT ISN&#39;T FROM KENYA. HE&#39;S BORN IN THE UNITED STATES. HE&#39;S A U.S. CITIZEN. HE&#39;S NOT A MUSLIM. HE&#39;S A CHRISTIAN. LET&#39;S MOVE ON TO SOME IMPORTANT  ECONOMIC ISSUES.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, WITHOUT DOING THAT,  KRYSTAL, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS NARROWING ITS TENT AT A TIME  WHEN IT&#39;S IN HUGE TROUBLE. I MEAN, THE NEW NBC/WALL STREET  JOURNAL POLL ASKS WHO THEY WOULD CHOOSE AS THEIR MEMBER OF  CONGRESS. 35% SAID DEMOCRATS. 30% SAID THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATE. 28% SAID REPUBLICAN. I MEAN, HOW MUCH TROUBLE IS THIS PARTY IN? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; A HUGE AMOUNT. IT&#39;S EVEN WORSE, ACTUALLY, THAN  THOSE NUMBERS SHOW. I ASKED MARK MURRAY TODAY WHO  MADE UP THAT 30% THAT WANTS A  THIRD-PARTY MER OF CONGRESS. HE SAID THE BIGGEST BLOCK WERE  REPUBLICANS WHO WERE NOT TEA  PARTY AFFILIATED. THESE ARE THE MORE MAINSTREAM  REPUBLICAN WHO IS ARE FRUSTRATED WITH THEIR OWN PARTY. SO THE NUMBERS ARE EVEN WORSE  THAN THAT LOOKS. AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS AS MUCH AS MITCH McCONNELL OR JOHN  BOEHNER MIGHT SAY WE&#39;RE NOT  HEADED TO ANOTHER SHOWDOWN,  WE&#39;RE NOT HEADED TO ANOTHER  SHUTDOWN LIKE WE JUST  EXPERIENCED, TED CRUZ HASN&#39;T  CHANGED HIS RHETORIC AT ALL. AND HE STILL WANTS TO HOLD THIS  COUNTRY HOSTAGE OVER OBAMA CARE. HE STILL WANTS TO BE THE LEADERS OF THE LEMMINGS WITH SUICIDE  VESTS AS ONE REPUBLICAN MEMBER  OF CONGRESS CALLED THEM. HE WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT WANTED  TO DO THIS THE LAST TIME AROUND. I DON&#39;T SEE HOW THE REPUBLICAN  PARTY GETS OUT OF THIS ENDLESS  CYCLE OF CONTINUING PURITY TESTS AND CONTINUE MEANDERING TO THE  RIGHT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; KRYSTAL BALL AND FORMER  DMPB --  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I WAS ABOUT TO SAY THAT&#39;S A  GREAT POINT. THIS IS GOING TO BE A BIG TEST  FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY COMING  UP IN JANUARY.","media$content":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":500000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":690.357,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":240,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/97sp0NYvRje2?feed=PoliticsNation","plfile$width":420,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":800000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":690.357,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":360,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/Gmk0rpFPXD_V?feed=PoliticsNation","plfile$width":640,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":690.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":0,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/c1qtNwlBLqt5?feed=PoliticsNation","plfile$width":0,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"media$thumbnails":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"image","plfile$duration":0.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"JPEG","plfile$height":1080,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_sharp_1lead_131031.jpg","plfile$width":1920,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"link":"","pubDate":1383262680000,"plmedia$defaultThumbnailUrl":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_sharp_1lead_131031.jpg","nnd$associatedPlaylist":{"href":"http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_44263878"},"nnd$brand":"MSNBC","nnd$bureau":"30RockNY","nnd$bviAssetId":"n_sharp_1lead_131031","nnd$canonicalUrl":{"href":"http://www.msnbc.com/politicsnation/watch/ted-cruz-and-dad-like-father-like-son-59078723595"},"nnd$distributionProfile":["MSN-CA","AWE"],"nnd$firstAiredAtUtc":1383256782000,"nnd$lastAiredAtUtc":1383256782000,"nnd$lastEditorialChangeAtUtc":1383316468000,"nnd$longTitle":"Ted Cruz and dad, like father like son","nnd$playCount30":7497,"nnd$playCountDay":170,"nnd$playCountYear":7529,"nnd$requiresCaptioning":true,"nnd$shortDescription":"As Ted Cruz’s father’s more inflammatory remarks about President Obama emerge, Rev.

SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS. THAT&#39;S RIGHT. SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS. THE GOP IS NOW USING THE LOVABLE CARTOON SEA SPONGE AS A NEW WAY  TO ATTACK THE SAFETY NET. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU&#39;RE FIRED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; OKAY. SO HERE&#39;S THE STORY. THE HARSH ECONOMIC CLIMATE HAS  HIT THE UNDERWATER COMMUNITY. AFTER 14 YEARS OF FLIPPING  KRABBY PATTIES, HE&#39;S FIRED FROM  HIS JOB. INSTEAD OF MOOCHING ALL OF  SERVICE, HE SETS OUT TO RETURN  TO THE WORKFORCE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; OKAY. SO A SPONGE WHO LIVES IN A  PINEAPPLE UNDER THE SEA DOESN&#39;T  NEED GOVERNMENT HELP. THAT MEANS NO ONE DOES? REPUBLICANS NEED TO GET A LIFE. AND LIFE ISN&#39;T A CARTOON. IN FACT, WHAT&#39;S GOING ON NOW IS  APPALLING. TOMORROW 47 MILLION AMERICANS  WILL SEE THEIR FOOD STAMP  BENEFITS CUT. 47 MILLION AMERICANS. THEY&#39;RE NOT MOOCHERS. 87% OF THOSE HOUSEHOLDS INCLUDE  CHILDREN, SENIORS, OR THE  DISABLED. 900,000 OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE  VETERANS. THEY SERVED THEIR COUNTRY AND  NOW NEED SOME HELP. YET I DON&#39;T SEE SENATOR TED CRUZ AND SARAH PALIN OUT RALLYING FOR THEM. I GUESS THEY ONLY COME TO THE  AID OF VETERANS WHEN IT&#39;S A GOOD PHOTO OP. WHEN IT&#39;S POLITICALLY  CONVENIENT. MOTHERS, CHILDREN, THE DISABLED, VETS, THOSE WHO ARE THE PEOPLE  WHO MAY HUNGRY STARTING TOMORROW AND YET OUR REPUBLICAN CONGRESS  WANTS THOSE PEOPLE TO GIVE MORE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I&#39;LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH MY COLLEAGUES TO IMPLEMENT REFORMS  IN THE S.N.A.P. PROGRAM TO CUT  BACK ON WASTE, FRAUD, ABUSE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ASKING PEOPLE TO WORK IN  RETURN FOR FOOD STAMP PROGRAMS  IS NOT ANY FORM OF CRUEL OR  UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT. THE DIGNITY OF WORK HAS LONG  BEEN A PRETTY COMMON THEME  THROUGHOUT THE AGES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHY DOES THE SAFETY NET NEED  REFORM? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HEAR THAT? THE DISABLED ARE GETTING TANGLED IN THE SAFETY NET. HUNGRY KIDS. THEY MUST BE PART OF THE  PROGRAM&#39;S WASTE. FOR YEARS NOW, THE GOP HAS  VILLAINIZED THE POOR. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THERE IS DIGNITY IN WORK. THE REFORMS MADE BY THIS BILL  WILL PUT PEOPLE ON THE PATH TO  SELF-SUFFICIENCY AND  INDEPENDENCE. THE DIGNITY OF THE JOB IS WHAT  THINGS SHOULD BE ABOUT IN THESE  PROGRAMS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE IRONIC  THING ABOUT THAT IS? WHAT&#39;S IRONIC ABOUT THAT IS  CONGRESSMAN CANTOR CONTROLS THE  GOP&#39;S LEGISLATIVE CALENDAR. HE&#39;S DECIDED THAT THE HOUSE GOP  SHOULD WORK JUST 16 MORE DAYS  BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THE  YEAR. FUNNY. WHERE&#39;S ALL THIS TALK ABOUT THE  DIGNITY OF HARD WORK NOW? JOINING ME NOW IS SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS OF VERMONT. SENATOR, THANK YOU FOR JOINING  ME TONIGHT. TOMORROW, SENATOR, MILLIONS OF  AMERICANS WILL SEE THEIR FOOD  BENEFITS CUT. HOW CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT TO  VIEWERS? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU KNOW, I FIND IT  INTERESTING THAT OUR REPUBLICAN  FRIENDS TALK ABOUT THE DIGNITY  OF WORK. I AGREE WITH THAT. AND THAT&#39;S WHY IN THIS COUNTRY  WE NEED TO CREATE MILLIONS AND  MILLIONS OF DECENT-PAYING JOBS. UNFORTUNATELY, AL, VIRTUALLY  EVERY EFFORT WE HAVE MADE TO  REBUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE,  CREATE JOBS THROUGH ENERGY  EFFICIENCY, CREATE A VETERANS&#39;  JOBS BILL, EVERY ONE OF THOSE  EFFORTS TO CREATE JOBS HAS BEEN  BEATEN BACK AND FILIBUSTERED BY  THE REPUBLICANS. MEANWHILE, WHAT&#39;S HAPPENING IN  AMERICA ECONOMICALLY IS THE  MIDDLE CLASS CONTINUES TO  SHRINK. MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE  BECOMING LOW INCOME. WE HAVE 46.5 MILLION AMERICANS  TODAY LIVING IN POVERTY. MORE THAN ANY TIME IN HISTORY. WE HAVE 22% OF OUR KIDS LIVING  IN POVERTY. THE HIGHEST RATE OF POVERTY IN  THE INDUSTRIALIZED WORLD. SO WHAT THESE GUYS ARE DOING ARE REALLY GOING TO WAR AGAINST  SENIORS, AGAINST THE KIDS,  AGAINST WORKING FAMILIES WHO ARE TRYING TO GET BY ON 9, 10 BUCKS  AN HOUR WHO JUST CAN&#39;T FEED  THEIR FAMILIES. MEANWHILE, THESE VERY SAME GUYS  FIGHTING AGAINST JOBS PROGRAMS  WANTING TO GIVE MORE TAX BREAKS  TO MILLIONAIRES AND  BILLIONAIRES. IT IS TOTALLY OBSCENE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BUT, YOU KNOW, SENATOR, THE  FOOD STAMP CUTS THAT WILL HIT  TOMORROW WILL SLASH ABOUT $5  BILLION FROM THE PROGRAM. NOW, THAT&#39;S LESS THAN THE $6.9  BILLION WE SPENT IN FIGHTER JET  CONTRACTS JUST THIS YEAR ALONE. AND GET THIS. IT&#39;S A FIGHTER JET PROGRAM THAT  THE PENTAGON DOESN&#39;T EVEN WANT. WHY DON&#39;T THEY CUT IT FROM  THERE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; OH, WELL, AL, I GUESS THE  ANSWER HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH  POOR PEOPLE AND WORKING PEOPLE  DO NOT MAKE LARGE CAMPAIGN  CONTRIBUTIONS. OUR MILITARY INDUSTRIAL  CONTRACTORS DO. BILLIONAIRES DO. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT  NOT ONLY ARE WE GOING TO LOOK AT A MAJOR CUT IN FOOD STAMPS  TOMORROW AS YOU WELL KNOW, THE  REPUBLICAN BILL -- FARM BILL  PASSED IN THE HOUSE CALLS FOR  ANOTHER $40 BILLION IN CUTS OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. SO THESE GUYS AT A TIME WHEN  MANY OF OUR KIDS ARE FACING REAL CHALLENGES GETTING THE FOOD THEY NEED, THE NUTRITION THEY NEED,  THESE GUYS ARE GOING TO WAR  AGAINST THE KIDS. THEY WANT MORE AND MORE FOR THE  MILITARY AND MORE TAX BREAKS FOR THE RICH. THAT IS REALLY -- THAT IS  INCREDIBLE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, REPUBLICANS HAVE  ALSO BEEN AGAINST RAISING THE  MINIMUM WAGE. BUT THAT&#39;S BARELY ENOUGH TO GET  BY. I MEAN, DO THE MATH. SALARY FOR FULL-TIME MINIMUM  WAGE WORKER IS JUST $15,000 A  YEAR. THE AVERAGE RENT FOR ONE-BEDROOM APARTMENT IS MORE THAN $13,000. HOW ARE PEOPLE SUPPOSED TO  AFFORD THINGS LIKE FOOD AND  CLOTHES? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU&#39;RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. BUT LET ME TELL YOUR VIEWERS  SOMETHING. IT IS NOT JUST THE REPUBLICANS  ARE FIGHTING OUR EFFORT TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE. MANY OF THEM WANT TO ABOLISH THE CONCEPT OF THE MINIMUM WAGE. THEY THINK -- THIS IS TRUE --  THAT $7.25 AN HOUR IS TOO MUCH. AND IF YOU&#39;RE IN A HIGH  UNEMPLOYMENT AREA, DETROIT OR  SOME PLACE ELSE AND AN EMPLOYER  OFFERS SOMEBODY 4 BUCKS ON HOUR, THAT&#39;S FREEDOM, AL. THAT&#39;S GETTING THE GOVERNMENT  OFF THE BACKS OF EMPLOYERS AND  WORKERS TO HAVE PEOPLE WORKING  FOR 3 OR 4 BUCKS AN HOUR. YOU&#39;RE LOOKING AT A REAL CLASS  WARFARE GOING ON HERE. AGAINST THE LOW INCOME PEOPLE TO BENEFIT THE WEALTHY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS EVENING. AND LET ME JUST SAY, TOMORROW  WHEN MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE CUT  IN THE FOOD STAMP PROGRAMS,  CHILDREN, SENIORS, VETERANS. IT&#39;S DISGUSTING. IT IS NOT THE AMERICA THAT ALL  OF US WANT TO SEE.

BLOCKING TWO OF PRESIDENT  OBAMA&#39;S KEY NOMINEES. ONE IS PATRICIA MILLINT, A JUDGE UP FOR THE SPOT ON THE D.C.  CIRCUIT COURT WHO SERVED BOTH  UNDER BOTH DEMOCRATIC AND  REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTS. THE OTHER IS CONGRESSMAN MEL  WATT. THE PRESIDENT&#39;S PICK TO LEAD A  FEDERAL HOUSING AGENCY. HE&#39;S A RESPECTED MEMBER OF  CONGRESS WHO HAS THE SUPPORT  FROM THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY. BUT TO REPUBLICANS, BLOCKING  THESE TWO APPOINTMENTS ARE JUST  ANOTHER WAY TO TRY TO HURT  PRESIDENT OBAMA. WE&#39;VE SEEN IT AGAIN AND AGAIN ON ISSUE AFTER ISSUE. WITH THIS REPUBLICAN PARTY, THEY HAVE SUCH ANTIPATHY FOR THIS  PRESIDENT AND HIS AGENDA, THEY  ROOT FOR HIS FAILURE. EVEN IF IT&#39;S BAD FOR THE  COUNTRY. THEY&#39;LL DO EVERYTHING. EVEN MISTAKE THE FACTS. HERE&#39;S WHAT GOP LEADERS SAID  THIS WEEK ABOUT GOVERNMENT  SPENDING. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THIS DEBT, IT WEIGHS ON OUR  ECONOMY TODAY. WE&#39;RE NOT DOING MUCH ABOUT IT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; OUR COUNTRY IS ON AN  UNSUSTAINABLE FISCAL COURSE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE HAVE HAD RECORD DEFICITS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; RECORD DEFICITS FOR THE PAST  FIVE YEARS? THE SENATOR CONVENIENTLY LEFT  OUT SOME MAJOR INFORMATION. UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA, DEFICITS  HAVE GONE DOWN FIVE STRAIGHT  YEARS. THE FASTEST DROP SINCE WORLD WAR II. DOWN $409 BILLION SINCE 2012. REPUBLICANS ARE QUIET ABOUT  THAT, BUT THEY&#39;RE STILL MAKING  STUFF UP ABOUT HEALTH CARE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHAT I WANT IS THE FINEST  POSSIBLE HEALTH CARE FOR AMERICA THAT WE CAN HAVE. WE DID HAVE FABULOUS HEALTH  CARE, AND I THINK WE CAN AGAIN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ALMOST 50 MILLION AMERICANS  LACKED COVERAGE BEFORE OBAMA  CARE. AND IT WAS FABULOUS? WHEN YOU&#39;RE DESPERATE FOR THE  PRESIDENT TO FAIL, YOU REALLY  WILL DO AND SAY ANYTHING. WELL, WE&#39;RE NOT GOING TO FALL  FOR IT OR LET THEM GET AWAY WITH IT. JOINING ME NOW IS CONGRESSMAN  JIM McDERMOTT DEMOCRAT FROM  WASHINGTON AND MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR GOLDIE TAYLOR. THANK YOU TO BOTH OF YOU FOR  JOINING ME. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; GOOD TO BE HERE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CONGRESSMAN, SOME REPUBLICANS WANT TO PRETEND COVERAGE IN  AMERICA USED TO BE FABULOUS. I MEAN, HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH  THAT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU KNOW, AL, IT&#39;S  REALLY TOUGH WHEN THEY WANT TO  ARGUE WITH THEIR -- THEY MAKE UP THEIR OWN FACTS. IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS OUT  OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION OR YOU LOOK OUT OF ANY SET OF  NUMBERS ABOUT WHERE THE UNITED  STATES RANKS, WE DO NOT HAVE THE BEST HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE  COUNTRY. WE HAVE ACCESS TO THE BEST IF  YOU HAVE MONEY. IF YOU HAVE INSURANCE. BUT IF YOU DON&#39;T HAVE INSURANCE, YOU DON&#39;T HAVE PREVENTIVE CARE. YOU DON&#39;T HAVE ANYTHING UNTIL  YOU&#39;RE SUDDENLY IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM IN A DIRE MESS. AND THAT&#39;S WHAT AMERICA IS  REALLY ALL ABOUT. IS TAKING PEOPLE -- CARE OF THEM WHEN THEY GET SICK. NOT IN PREVENTING ILLNESS OR  ENCOURAGING WELLNESS. IF WE CAN THAT, WE WOULD HAVE  THE BEST HEALTH CARE IN THE  WORLD. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOW, YOU KNOW, GOLDIE, RUSH  LIMBAUGH THE HEAD OF THE PARTY  SAID TODAY THAT -- LET ME LET  YOU HEAR WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE  AFFORDABLE CARE ACT FOR  YOURSELF. LISTEN TO THIS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ALL IT DOES IS DRIVE UP  PRICES LIKE BREAST PUMPS AND  BIRTH CONTROL PILLS AND WELLNESS PLANS. ALL OF THAT STUFF. ALL OF THIS TOUCHY, FEELY,  LIBERAL DO-GOOD STUFF THAT OUGHT NEVER BE PART OF INSURANCE. BUY YOUR OWN BIRTH CONTROL PILL. BUY YOUR OWN BREAST PUMP. THAT&#39;S NOT A HEALTH ISSUE. THAT&#39;S NOT INSURANCE. IT&#39;S WELFARE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I MEAN, I DON&#39;T KNOW IF IT  GETS ANY MORE OUTRAGEOUS THAN  THAT, GOLDIE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, THIS REALLY IS THE  YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING. TO SAY THAT BREAST PUMPS AND  BIRTH CONTROL ARE NOT PREVENTIVE CARE, IT&#39;S LIVING IN ANOTHER  WORLD. YOU&#39;RE ENTITLED TO YOUR OWN  OPINION BUT NOT YOUR OWN FACT. CERTAINLY WITH BREAST PUMPS THAT ENCOURAGE EARLY CHILDHOOD  NUTRITION GOES A LONG WAY  TOWARDS BUILDING A HEALTHY  INDIVIDUAL WHO CAN BE PRODUCTIVE IN THIS SOCIETY AND BE MORE  PRODUCTIVE ECONOMICALLY. SO THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO INVEST IN AS A  COUNTRY RATHER THAN COMING IN ON THE BACK END WHEN SOMEONE IS  ALREADY SICK. WHEN SOMEONE IS ALREADY FACING  CATASTROPHIC INSTANCES IN OUR  NATION&#39;S ERs WHICH THEMSELVES  DRIVE UP HEALTH CARE COSTS LIKE  NO OTHER THING IN THIS COUNTRY. I&#39;LL SAY SOMETHING ELSE. HEALTH CARE COSTS ALONE ARE THE  NUMBER ONE DRIVER OF FINANCIAL  DISTRESS IN THIS COUNTRY FOR  FAMILIES. THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF DIVORCE  IN THIS COUNTRY FOR FAMILIES IS  FINANCIAL DISTRESS. AND SO THIS IS THE PARTY OF  FAMILIES, THEN THEY OUGHT TO BE  ABOUT THE FAMILY OF PROVIDING -- THE PARTY PROVIDING AFFORDABLE  HEALTH CARE FOR ALL FAMILIES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, CONGRESSMAN, GOLDIE SAID WE CAN HAVE DIFFERENT  OPINIONS, NOT DIFFERENT FACTS. WELL, YOU KNOW, SARAH PALIN  NEVER LET FACTS GET IN HER WAY. ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO  ATTACKING OBAMA CARE. LISTEN TO THIS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; OF COURSE THERE ARE DEATH  PANELS. GETTING RID OF THE SOCIALIZED  HEALTH CARE COVERAGE POLICY OF  BARACK OBAMA&#39;S. NOT ONLY DOES IT STRIP AWAY OUR  FREEDOMS AS AMERICANS, BUT OBAMA CARE WILL BANKRUPT SO MANY  BUSINESSES AND IT WILL CONTINUE  TO ADD TO THE BANKRUPTCY OF OUR  NATION ALREADY $17 TRILLION IN  DEBT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I MEAN, HOW DO WE DEAL WITH  THESE KIND OF STATEMENTS AND  COULD YOU TELL US THE FACT,  CONGRESSMAN, WILL THIS  CONTRIBUTE -- OBAMA CARE -- AS  SARAH PALIN CHARGED TO THE DEBT  OF THIS COUNTRY? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY NOT, AL. THE FACT IS THAT IF YOU GIVE  PEOPLE PREVENTIVE CARE, IT&#39;S  MUCH CHEAPER TO TAKE MY BLOOD  PRESSURE AND TO GIVE ME SOME  PILLS TO TAKE CARE OF MY HIGH  BLOOD PRESSURE THAN IT IS TO  TAKE CARE OF MY STROKE. A STROKE INCIDENT WILL TAKE  $100,000 OR $200,000 WHEREAS FOR A FEW BUCKS YOU COULD PREVENT  THAT. AND THE SAME IS TRUE WITH HEART  DISEASE AND WITH DIABETES AND  ALL THE CHRONIC DISEASES WITH A  VERY LITTLE BIT OF MONEY UP  FRONT IN PREVENTION AND  PROVIDING GOOD NUTRITION TO  PEOPLE. YOU CAN PREVENT A LOT OF WHAT WE WIND UP SPENDING THOUSANDS AND  THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN THE  EMERGENCY ROOM. YOU TAKE CARE OF WOMEN&#39;S HEALTH  CARE. IF A WOMAN HAS TESTS FOR A  VAGINAL CANCER OR CERVICAL  CANCER OR WHATEVER, THAT COSTS  VERY LITTLE. BUT IF YOU WIND UP HAVING  SURGERY, IT&#39;S A BIG EXPENSE. AND CANCER, CHEMOTHERAPY AND  RADIATION IS VERY EXPENSIVE. SO PREVENTION IS WHAT YOU GET  WHEN YOU HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE. YOU CAN GO TO THE DOCTOR WHEN  YOU SENSE THERE&#39;S THE BEGINNING  OF A PROBLEM. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, GOLDIE, THE RIGHT  WING PUNDITS SAID THEY ACTUALLY  CHEERED THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN  AND SAID THAT THERE WAS NO  DOWNSIDE. WATCH THIS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HE WANTS TO CONVINCE YOU THAT IF THE ECONOMIC STATE OF THE  UNION GETS WORSE IT&#39;S BECAUSE OF THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. NOT TRUE. THE REASON THE ECONOMY REMAINS  STAGNANT IS OBAMA CARE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; PEOPLE ARE PROBABLY GOING TO  REALIZE THEY CAN LIVE WITH A LOT LESS GOVERNMENT THAN WHAT THEY  THOUGHT THEY NEEDED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ANOTHER THING THAT GOP  LEADERSHIP NEEDS TO DO IS REMIND THE PUBLIC THIS IS NOT  ARMAGEDDON. THIS IS A PINPRICK. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE  HAVE SEEN THE GOVERNMENT  SLOWDOWN NOT SHUTDOWN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; MAYBE I&#39;M ONE OF THE FEW  PEOPLE, THIS DOESN&#39;T IMPACT ME  MENTALLY. WE&#39;VE HAD 17 GOVERNMENT  SHUTDOWNS, GOVERNOR. I&#39;M NOT AFRAID OF A COUPLE OF  WEEKS OF GOVERNMENT BEING SHUT  DOWN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE&#39;RE REALLY VERY ENERGIZED  TODAY. WE&#39;RE VERY STRONG. THIS WAS ABOUT THE HAPPIEST I&#39;VE SEEN MEMBERS IN A LONG TIME. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I MEAN, $24 BILLION THIS COST US, GOLDIE, TO SHUT DOWN. DOESN&#39;T MEAN ANYTHING. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; $24 BILLION, BUT SEAN HANNITY CANNOT PROCESS HOW A SHUTDOWN  WOULD IMPACT HIM. CERTAINLY IT DOESN&#39;T IMPACT HIM  BECAUSE HE ISN&#39;T DRAWING HIS  CHECK FROM GOVERNMENT. BUT THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE  FEDERAL PAYROLL, THOSE HARD  WORKING PEOPLE WHO GO TO THE  OFFICE EVERY DAY AND WORK ON  BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,  IT WAS MORE THAN A PINPRICK FOR  THEM TO LOSE WEEK&#39;S WORTH OF  PAY. SOME 17 TIMES THIS COUNTRY HAS  SHUT DOWN ITS GOVERNMENT. SO IT DOES HAVE REAL IMPACTS ON  VERY REAL PEOPLE. AND ANOTHER THING, IF YOU ARE  GOING TO SHUT DOWN THE  GOVERNMENT, THAT MEANS YOU ARE  NOT INVESTING IN NEW JOBS IN  THIS COUNTRY. THE NUMBER ONE WAY TO DECADES  THE DEFICIT IN THIS COUNTRY ARE  PUT PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. YOU HAVE MORE TAX PAYING  CITIZENS AND YOU CAN EXPAND WHAT PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO DO IN THEIR  DAILY LIVES. SO I THINK THE REPUBLICANS ARE  ATTACKING THIS FROM THE WRONG  END OF THE PROBLEM. WHAT THEY OUGHT TO BE DOING IS  ABOUT INVESTING IN THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE. FOR INSTANCE, THEY WANTED TO CUT THE S.N.A.P. PROGRAM. THAT&#39;S GOING TO IMPACT 5,000  ACTIVE DUTY SERVICEMEN AND  WOMEN. AND RETIRED VETERANS WHO DEPEND  ON THOSE BENEFITS TO MAKE THEIR  WAY. AND SO IF THEY&#39;RE GOING TO HAVE  THIS CONVERSATION, LET&#39;S HAVE  THE WHOLE CONVERSATION AND NOT  LEAVE ANYTHING OUT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CONGRESSMAN JIM McDERMOTT AND","media$content":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":500000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":571.905,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":240,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/H9o_qGylrGD7?feed=PoliticsNation","plfile$width":420,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":800000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":571.905,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":360,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/gsbX2UujLQW9?feed=PoliticsNation","plfile$width":640,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":571.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":0,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/3c2qTmZIRB93?feed=PoliticsNation","plfile$width":0,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"media$thumbnails":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"image","plfile$duration":0.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"JPEG","plfile$height":1080,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_sharp_3aca_131031.jpg","plfile$width":1920,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"link":"","pubDate":1383262560000,"plmedia$defaultThumbnailUrl":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_sharp_3aca_131031.jpg","nnd$associatedPlaylist":{"href":"http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_44263878"},"nnd$brand":"MSNBC","nnd$bureau":"30RockNY","nnd$bviAssetId":"n_sharp_3aca_131031","nnd$canonicalUrl":{"href":"http://www.msnbc.com/politicsnation/watch/still-desperate-for-obama-to-fail-59080771564"},"nnd$distributionProfile":["MSN-CA","AWE"],"nnd$firstAiredAtUtc":1383258600000,"nnd$lastAiredAtUtc":1383258600000,"nnd$lastEditorialChangeAtUtc":1383316472000,"nnd$longTitle":"Still desperate for Obama to fail","nnd$playCount30":4960,"nnd$playCountDay":132,"nnd$playCountYear":4987,"nnd$requiresCaptioning":true,"nnd$shortDescription":"Rev.

TODAY A FEDERAL PROSECUTOR IN  GEORGIA ANNOUNCED HE IS OPENING  AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE  CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE  DEATH OF KENDRICK JOHNSON, THE  17-YEAR-OLD WHOSE BODY WAS FOUND IN A ROLLED UP MAT IN HIS HIGH  SCHOOL GYM IN JANUARY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; MY OBJECTIVE IS TO DISCOVER  THE TRUTH, AND I BELIEVE THAT  CAN ONLY BE DONE BY GATHERING  ALL OF THE EVIDENCE AND RELEVANT INFORMATION SURROUNDING MR.  JOHNSON&#39;S DEATH. I AM COMMITTED TO DOING  EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THAT EXIST IN THIS CASE OR AS MANY OF THEM AS WE  CAN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THERE ARE MANY QUESTIONS. AUTHORITIES RULED THE DEATH AN  ACCIDENT SAYING JOHNSON  SUFFOCATED INSIDE THESE MAT  WHILE REACHING FOR A SNEAKER. BUT JOHNSON&#39;S PARENTS NEVER  BELIEVED THAT. THEY SAY HE WAS MURDERED, AND  THEY LAUNCHED AN EFFORT TO  REOPEN THE CASE. I WAS WITH THE FAMILY IN MAY AS  PART OF THEIR ATTEMPTS TO GET  THE CASE FULLY EXAMINED WHICH IS WHAT IS FINALLY HAPPENING NOW. NEW SURVEILLANCE VIDEO SHOWS  KENDRICK WAS NOT ALONE IN THE  GYM. ON THE TAPE YOU SEE KENDRICK  WALKING INTO THE GYM AND ONTO  THE BASKETBALL COURT WHERE OTHER STUDENTS WERE PLAYING. IF HE WASN&#39;T ALONE IN THE GYM,  WOULDN&#39;T SOMEONE HAVE HEARD HIM  IF HE WAS IN TROUBLE INSIDE THAT MAT? IT&#39;S A MYSTERY THAT FEDERAL  AUTHORITIES MAY NOW GET TO THE  BOTTOM OF. JOINING ME NOW ARE KENDRICK&#39;S  PARENTS. KENNETH AND JACQUELINE JOHNSON  AND THEIR ATTORNEYS BENJAMIN  CRUMP AND MR. KING. THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE  TONIGHT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; FIRST OF ALL, LET ME AGAIN  EXTEND MY CONDOLENCES TO YOU  KENNETH AND JACQUELINE. YOUR SON&#39;S DEATH WAS RULED AN  ACCIDENT. YOU DON&#39;T BELIEVE THAT. WHY? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BECAUSE FROM THE VERY  BEGINNING, TWO DAYS LATER AFTER  I VIEWED HIS BODY, YOU CAN  ACTUALLY LOOK DOWN AND TELL THAT SOMETHING HAD OCCURRED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOW, THE PROSECUTOR SAID  TODAY -- LISTEN TO THIS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; FACTS, NOT FEELINGS OR  OPINIONS NOW MATTER HOW SINCERE  THEY MAY BE ARE PART OF THE  LEGAL INVESTIGATION. I DO THIS WITH AN OPEN MIND  NEITHER REJECTING OR ACCEPTING  THE OPINIONS OF ANYONE WHO HAS  PREVIOUSLY INVESTIGATING THE  CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS DEATH. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LET ME ASK YOU PARENTS, WHAT  DO YOU HOPE THE INVESTIGATION  DISCOVERS AND WILL YOU ACCEPT  THE OUTCOME OF THE INVESTIGATION WHICHEVER WAY IT GOES? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, AS LONG AS IT COME UT,  THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO KENDRICK, WE&#39;LL ACCEPT IT. BUT IT&#39;S GOT TO BE THE TRUTH. BECAUSE FOR A LONG TIME, YOU  KNOW, WE&#39;VE JUST BEEN -- THAT&#39;S  ALL WE EVER ASKED FOR WAS THE  TRUTH. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ATTORNEY KING, WHAT IS IT  THAT YOU&#39;RE LOOKING FOR. YOU&#39;VE BEEN IN THIS CASE AND  MOVED A LOT TO GET THE FAMILY TO THIS POINT. WHAT DO YOU HOPE WILL COME OUT  OF THIS FEDERAL INVESTIGATION? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, IN THE FIRST INSTANT,  REVEREND AL, WE ARE LOOKING FOR  A INVESTIGATION THAT WE CAN  BELIEVE IN. ONE THAT DEMONSTRATES A SINCERE  INTEREST IN IDENTIFYING THE  PERSONS RESPONSIBLE FOR  KENDRICK&#39;S DEATH. WHO CAN PRODUCE EVIDENCE OF WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED IF IT WAS AN  ACCIDENT WHICH I DON&#39;T BELIEVE  THAT IT WAS. BUT IF IT WAS AN ACCIDENT, THEN, OF COURSE, THERE OUGHT TO BE  PROOF THAT THE INVESTIGATION  COULD PRODUCE FOR THE PARENTS  AND FOR THE PUBLIC QUITE FRANKLY TO LOOK AT AND SAY, OKAY, I  UNDERSTAND AS STRANGE AS THE  THEORY THAT THE SHERIFF&#39;S OFFICE MAY SOUND, IT TURNS OUT TO BE  THE TRUTH. BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF THAT, WE  HAVE NO FAITH IN THE  INVESTIGATION DONE THUS FAR. WE ARE ENTHUSED ABOUT WHAT THE  U.S. ATTORNEY ANNOUNCED TODAY. HOWEVER, WE ARE GOING TO STILL  GO FORWARD IN PURSUING OUR OWN  INVESTIGATION AND MAKING AS MUCH INFORMATION AS WE CAN POSSIBLY  PRODUCE AVAILABLE TO THE U.S.  ATTORNEY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ATTORNEY CRUMP, THE THING  THAT STRUCK ME WHEN I WAS THERE  AND TALKED TO THE PARENTS IS  THAT THERE WAS AN INJURY ON THE  HEAD THAT DOES NOT -- THAT  SEEMED TO BE INCONSISTENT WITH  THE FINDINGS. WHAT IS IT THAT YOU FOUND THAT  WAS -- WHEN YOU CAME INTO THE  CASE THAT WAS SO COMPELLING THAT MADE YOU QUESTION THE FINDINGS  OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, OTHER THAN THE  RIDICULOUS EXPLANATION GIVEN BY  THE SHERIFF&#39;S DEPARTMENT THAT HE CLIMBED INTO A WRESTLING MAT,  GOT STUCK, AND DIED, REVEREND  SHARPTON. IT WAS THE FACT THERE WAS SO  MANY THINGS LIKE HIS CLOTHES WAS MISSING THAT HAD BLOOD THAT  WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT ON  HIM. HIS NAILS WERE CUT BACK THAT  COULD HAVE BEEN SKIN AND BLOOD  TO TELL WHAT HAPPENED. AND THE WORST, WHEN THEY DUG  THIS CHILD UP FOR THE SECOND  AUTOPSY, HIS ORGANS WERE  MISSING. THAT WOULD HAVE PROVIDED  EVIDENCE --  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HIS ORGANS WERE MISSING? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HIS ORGANS WERE MISSING. HIS BRAIN, HIS HEART. THEY THOUGHT THEY BURIED THEIR  WHOLE CHILD. TURNED OUT THEY ONLY BURIED HALF A CHILD. SO WE GOT TO FIND OUT WHAT  HAPPENED TO KENDRICK JOHNSON. THIS IS A MURDER MYSTERY AND  UNFORTUNATELY THE VICTIM IS  REAL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOW, KEN, THE COMMUNITY THERE BLACK AND WHITE IS RALLYING WITH YOU. I REMEMBER SEEING HUNDREDS OF  PEOPLE AND THAT THERE CERTAINLY  IS A LOT OF HELP IN THE  COMMUNITY TONIGHT. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY IF, IN FACT, PEOPLE WORK IN THAT GYM  THAT NIGHT, AND DO KNOW  SOMETHING AND KNOW SOMETHING  TONIGHT, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO  THOSE PEOPLE THAT WERE IN THAT  GYM THAT NIGHT NOW THAT THERE&#39;S  BEEN A FEDERAL INQUIRY. WHAT WOULD YOU WANT TO SAY TO  THEM? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I WOULD LIKE TO SAY TO THEM  THAT KENDRICK COULD HAVE BEEN  THEIR BROTHER OR RELATIVE. YOU KNOW? THEY DON&#39;T HAVE TO BE AFRAID NO  MORE. JUST COME OUT AND TELL THE TRUTH AND TELL WHAT REALLY HAPPENED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ATTORNEY KING, DO YOU THINK  THAT NOW THAT THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT RATHER THAN LOCAL  AUTHORITIES INVOLVED THAT IF  SOMEONE KNOWS SOMETHING, THEY  MAY FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE TO  COME FORWARD AND SAY SOMETHING  IF IN FACT THOSE TYPE OF PEOPLE  OR PERSON EXISTS? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY, REVEREND AL.

IT MAKES IT EVEN MORE IMPORTANT  WE ARE CLEAR ABOUT THE FACTS. UNLIKE FORMER MAYOR RUDY  GIULIANI WHO WENT ON FOX NEWS  LAST NIGHT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE REALITY IS THAT STOP AND  FRISK AND FOUR OR FIVE OTHER  PROGRAMS THAT I STARTED WITH  BILL BRATTON AND CONTINUED AND  THEN TAKEN OVER BY MIKE AND RAY  KELLY HAS SAVED 20,000 LIVES,  10,000 LIVES. I MEAN, TREMENDOUS AMOUNT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THEY THINK IT&#39;S RACIST. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW THE LIVES THAT WERE  SAVED? EIGHT OUT OF TEN  AFRICAN-AMERICANS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; STOP AND FRISK HAS SAVED THE  LIVES OF THOUSANDS OF  AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN NEW YORK. REALLY? HERE ARE THE FACTS. SINCE 2002, 86% OF THOSE STOPPED WERE LATINO. BUT 88% OF THESE STOPS DID NOT  RESULT IN AN ARREST OR A  SUMMONS. IN OTHER WORDS, THEY WERE  STOPPED FOR NOTHING. STOP AND FRISK HASN&#39;T SAVED  LIVES. IT&#39;S MADE INNOCENT PEOPLE FEEL  LIKE CRIMINALS. THE VICTIMS OF THIS PROGRAM POST THEIR VIDEOS ONLINE TO SHOW WHAT STOP AND FRISK IS REALLY ALL  ABOUT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHY DID YOU STOP AND FRISK  ME? I GOT IT. WHY DID YOU STOP AND FRISK ME?

I FIGHT HARD AGAINST VIOLENCE,  AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE IN ALL  COMMUNITIES INCLUDING THE BLACK  COMMUNITY. BUT YOU DON&#39;T SCAPEGOAT PEOPLE  WITH PROFILING AND MAKE THOSE  THAT ARE ALREADY AFRAID OF  CRIMINALS ALSO AFRAID OF POLICE. YOU PUT POLICE AND COMMUNITY  TOGETHER TO BRING CRIME DOWN. AND THAT IS THE WAY WE RAISE A  SOCIETY AND YOUNG PEOPLE IN THAT SOCIETY WITH MUTUAL RESPECT. AND HAVING LOW CRIME FIGURES. THAT&#39;S WHERE WE NEED TO GO. ALSO TONIGHT A STEP TOWARDS  JUSTICE FOR MARISSA ALEXANDER  WHO COULD GET OUT OF JAIL AS  SOON AS NEXT FRIDAY. SHE&#39;S THE FLORIDA MOTHER SEND TO PRISON FOR 20 YEARS AFTER FIRING A WARNING SHOT AT HER ABUSIVE  HUSBAND. SHE TRIED TO CLAIM A STAND YOUR  GROUND DEFENSE BUT WAS DENIED. AN EXAMPLE OF THE UNFAIR  APPLICATIONS OF THAT UNJUST LAW. WELL, TODAY A JUDGE SET A NEW  DATE FOR HER TRIAL. MARCH 31st. AND HE SET A BOND HEARING FOR  NEXT FRIDAY. IN JUST A FEW DAYS SHE COULD BE  OUT OF JAIL AND BACK WITH HER  FRIENDS AND FAMILY. MARISSA&#39;S CASE HAS SPARKED A  NATIONAL OUTCRY. IGNITING A GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT  TO SET HER FREE. AND CHANGE THE UNJUST STAND YOUR GROUND LAW. WE&#39;LL BE WATCHING. THESE HEARINGS AND PROCEEDINGS. AND HOPE JUSTICE WILL FINALLY BE SERVED. WHEN WE LOOK AT MARISSA  ALEXANDER, A WOMAN WHO WAS, IN  FACT, THREATENED BY HER HUSBAND  AND WHO HAD HAD SEVERAL PEACE  WARRANTS AGAINST HIM, HERE WAS A WOMAN OBVIOUSLY WHO HURT NO ONE, SHOT NOBODY, SHOT AT NO ONE. DOING 20 YEARS IN JAIL. IT SHOWS HOW LUDICROUS IT IS TO  HAVE STAND YOUR GROUND LAWS THAT PROTECT PEOPLE WHO SHOOT AND  THEN OTHERS THAT FIRE WARNING  SHOTS THAT HAVE A HISTORY OF  BEING ABUSED.

AND THANK YOU FOR TUNING IN. TONIGHT&#39;S LEAD, THE PRESIDENT  HITS BACK ON HEALTH CARE. TODAY PRESIDENT OBAMA WENT TOE  TO TOE AGAINST ALL THOSE RIGHT  WING CRITICS WHO HAVE BEEN  SLAMMING THE AFFORDABLE CARE  ACT. JUST A SHORT TIME AGO IN BOSTON, THE PRESIDENT ADDRESSED TO THOSE CRITICS HEAD ON AND TOLD THEM TO EXPLAIN THEMSELVES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S NO SURPRISE THAT SOME OF THE SAME FOLKS TRYING TO SCARE  PEOPLE NOW ARE THE SAME FOLKS  WHO&#39;VE BEEN TRYING TO SINK THE  AFFORDABLE CARE ACT FROM THE  BEGINNING. AND I&#39;VE SAID BEFORE, FOLKS HAD  ACTUALLY GOOD IDEAS, BETTER  IDEAS THAN WHAT&#39;S HAPPENING IN  MASSACHUSETTS OR WHAT WE&#39;VE  PROPOSED, FOR PROVIDING PEOPLE  WITH HEALTH INSURANCE I&#39;D BE  HAPPY TO LISTEN. BUT THAT&#39;S NOT WHAT&#39;S HAPPENING. AND ANYONE DEFENDING THE  REMNANTS OF THE OLD BROKEN  SYSTEM AS IF IT WAS WORKING FOR  PEOPLE -- ANYBODY WHO THINKS WE  SHOULDN&#39;T FINISH THE JOB OF  MAKING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM  WORK FOR EVERYBODY, ESPECIALLY  WHEN THESE FOLKS OFFER NO PLAN  FOR THE UNINSURED OR  UNDERINSURED OR FOLKS WHO LOSE  THEIR INSURANCE EACH YEAR. THOSE FOLKS SHOULD HAVE TO  EXPLAIN THEMSELVES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IF REPUBLICANS HAVE A BETTER  PLAN, THEY SHOULD PUT UP OR SHUT UP. BUT THEY CAN&#39;T. BECAUSE THE HEART OF OBAMA CARE  WAS ORIGINALLY A CONSERVATIVE  IDEA. AND TODAY, THE PRESIDENT MADE  SURE REPUBLICANS REMEMBERED  THAT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THIS IS THE HALL WHERE SEVEN  YEARS AGO DEMOCRATS AND  REPUBLICANS CAME TOGETHER TO  MAKE HEALTH REFORM A REALITY FOR THE PEOPLE OF MASSACHUSETTS. MANY OF THE FOLKS WHO ARE HERE  TODAY JOINED FORCES TO CONNECT  THE PROGRESSIVE VISION OF HEALTH CARE FOR ALL WITH SOME IDEAS  ABOUT MARKETS AND COMPETITION  THAT HAD LONG BEEN CHAMPIONED BY CONSERVATIVES AND HAS DUVAL JUST SAID, IT WORKED. IT WORKED. [ APPLAUSE ] &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; GEE, I KNEW THAT HALL LOOKED  FAMILIAR. BACK IN 2006 THAT&#39;S WHERE THEN  GOVERNOR ROMNEY SIGNED THE  MASSACHUSETTS HEALTH CARE LAW. THE SAME LAW THAT BECOME THE  FRAMEWORK FOR THE AFFORDABLE  CARE ACT. I DON&#39;T REMEMBER CONSERVATIVES  COMPLAINING ABOUT THE LAW THEN. BACK THEN EVERYONE WAS ALL  SMILES, EVEN THIS GUY. A TOP OFFICIAL AT THE  CONSERVATIVE THINK TANK, THE  HERITAGE FOUNDATION. LOOK HOW HAPPY HE IS. BUT NOW SUDDENLY THE HERITAGE  FOUNDATION IS THE GROUP LEADING  THE CHARGE AGAINST THE  PRESIDENT&#39;S HEALTH CARE LAW. IT&#39;S EVEN SUPPORTED SENATOR TED  CRUZ&#39;S ANTI-OBAMA CARE TOUR THIS SUMMER. AND TODAY SENATOR CRUZ CONTINUED THAT CRUSADE AT THE HEADQUARTERS FOR THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT IS A PARTICULAR PRIVILEGE  BEING HERE AT HERITAGE, HERITAGE PLAYS SUCH AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN  HELPING ARTICULATE AND DEFEND  CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES ACROSS  THIS COUNTRY. AND IN NO FIGHT HAS THAT BEEN  MORE APPARENT THAN IN THE FIGHT  OVER OBAMA CARE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BUT REPUBLICANS WERE ON THE  OTHER SIDE OF THAT FIGHT JUST A  FEW YEARS AGO. THEY&#39;VE COMPLETELY FLIP-FLOPPED. NOW THE WHOLE RIGHT WING IS  AGAINST IT. WHY? BECAUSE PRESIDENT OBAMA IS FOR  IT. BUT HE&#39;S COME TOO FAR TO BACK  DOWN NOW. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND IF IF WAS HARD DOING IT  JUST IN ONE STATE, IT&#39;S HARDER  TO DO NO ALL 50 STATES. ESPECIALLY WHEN THE GOVERNORS OF A BUNCH OF STATES AND HALF OF  THE CONGRESS AREN&#39;T TRYING TO  HELP. YEAH. IT&#39;S HARD, BUT IT&#39;S WORTH IT. IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AND WE&#39;RE GOING TO KEEP MOVING  FORWARD. WHAT CAN HAPPEN HERE IN  MASSACHUSETTS COULD HAPPEN ALL  ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND FOR THEM AND FOR YOU WE ARE  GOING TO SEE THIS THROUGH. [ APPLAUSE ] &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; JOINING ME NOW IS  CONGRESSWOMAN EDWARDS FROM  MARYLAND AND JONATHAN GREW BAR,  MIT ECONOMIST AND HE&#39;S ALSO  ADVISED BOTH PRESIDENT OBAMA AND ROMNEY ON THE HEALTH CARE LAWS. THANK YOU FOR BEING ON THE SHOW  TONIGHT. CONGRESSWOMAN, THIS ISN&#39;T ABOUT  WEBSITE GLITCHES. IT&#39;S THE BASIC RIGHT OF HEALTH  CARE FOR EVERYBODY. AND THAT WAS THE PRESIDENT&#39;S  POINT IN HIS SPEECH TODAY,  RIGHT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT&#39;S RIGHT. THE WEBSITE IS GOING TO BE  FIXED. THESE ARE TECHNICAL PROBLEM, AND THEY&#39;RE WORKING THROUGH THEM. THE KEY POINT IS THAT NOW TODAY  WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT  PEOPLE CAN HAVE QUALITY,  AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE HEALTH CARE, AND THAT WILL BE TRUE FOR  MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND FOR  MILLIONS MORE WHO HAD SUB  STANDARD HEALTH CARE PLANS THAT  NOW HAVE TO MEET SOME MINIMUM  STANDARD SO THAT THEY CAN MEET  THE NEEDS OF THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOW JONATHAN, YOU ADVISED ON  BOTH THE ROMNEY PLAN IN  MASSACHUSETTS, AND YOU&#39;VE  ADVISED PRESIDENT OBAMA. ARE THESE PLANS SIMILAR? IS THERE ANY MAJOR DIFFERENCES? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AL, THE FEDERAL LAW IS BASED  ON THE MASSACHUSETTS LAW. IT&#39;S REALLY THE SAME BASIC  STRUCTURE. IT&#39;S A GREAT STRUCTURE. IT&#39;S WORKED INCREDIBLY  SUCCESSFULLY HERE. WE&#39;VE COVERED 2/3 OF THE  UNINSURED AND IT&#39;S BEEN BROADLY  POPULAR. AND IT WILL BE ONCE AMERICANS  UNDERSTAND WHAT&#39;S IN THIS LAW. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BUT THE MAIN DIFFERENCE IS  THE MANDATE, RIGHT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NO. THE MANDATE WAS PUT IN PLACE  HERE IN MASSACHUSETTS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; OH, WAIT A MINUTE. THERE WAS A MANDATE IN  MASSACHUSETTS? SO ALL THIS CRITICISM ABOUT THE  MANDATE NOW FEDERAL, THEY FORGOT ABOUT THE MANDATE IN  MASSACHUSETTS? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE BASIC FRAMEWORK OF A  MANDATE WAS DEVELOPED BY THE  HERITAGE FOUNDATION IN THE EARLY 1990s AS OPPOSITION TO THE  CLINTON HEALTH CARE PLAN. IT WAS ADOPTED BY GOVERNOR  ROMNEY, BECAME THE LAW. PRESIDENT OBAMA WHO REMEMBER WAS INITIALLY OPPOSED TO THE MANDATE CAME AROUND TO UNDERSTAND THIS  IS THE RIGHT WAY TO DO THINGS. AND TO HIS CREDIT HE ADOPTED IT  AND MAID A PART OF IT PLAN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CONGRESSWOMAN, THAT&#39;S  BREAKING NEWS. THEY WERE THE ONES THAT WANTED A MANDATE AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO  CLINTON. AND NOW THEY&#39;RE THE ONES THAT  ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE  CRITICIZING THE MANDATE IN THE  AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. THAT&#39;S GOT TO BE A NEWS FLASH. I&#39;M SURE PEOPLE DON&#39;T FLOW THAT. LET ME ASK YOU THIS,  CONGRESSWOMAN. PEOPLE ARE BEING KICKED OFF  THEIR CURRENT PLANS IS GROCERY  MISLEADING THE PRESIDENT SAID  TODAY. LISTEN TO THIS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF  PEOPLE WHO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE THAT WORKS YOU CAN KEEP IT. FOR THE FEWER THAN 5% OF  AMERICANS WHO BUY INSURANCE ON  THEIR OWN, YOU WILL BE GETTING A BETTER DEAL. SO ANYONE PEDDLING THE MOTION  THAT INSURERS ARE CANCELING  PEOPLE&#39;S PLAN WITHOUT MENTIONING THAT ALMOST ALL THE INSURERS ARE ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO JOIN  BETTER PLANS WITH THE SAME  CARRIER WITH STRONGER BENEFITS  AND STRONGER PROTECTIONS, OTHER  ALSO BE ABLE TO GET PLANS ABOUT  NEW CARRIERS THROUGH THE  MARKETPLACE. AND MANY WILL GET NEW HELP TO  PAY FOR THESE PLANS AND MAKE  THEM CHEAPER. IF YOU LEAVE THAT STUFF OUT,  YOU&#39;RE BEING GROSSLY MISLEADING  TO SAY THE LEAST. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; GROSSLY MISLEADING,  CONGRESSWOMAN. THEY MISLED US ON MANDATES  BECAUSE THEY ADVOCATED. NOW THE PRESIDENT IS SAYING IT  IS NOT ACCURATE WHEN THEY SAY  THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING  CANCELLATION NOTICES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, I THINK THAT&#39;S RIGHT. AND REALLY, IF I HAD HAD MY WAY  WE WOULD HAVE A SINGLE PAIR PLAN OR A PUB PLIK OPTION. INSTEAD, WE ACCEPTED THE  REPUBLICAN PLAN THAT WAS PUT IN  PLACE IN MASSACHUSETTS. AND WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID IS  ABSOLUTELY CLEAR, AND I&#39;M REALLY APPRECIATIVE OF HIM OF  CLARIFYING THAT FOR 95% OF US  WHO HAVE AN EMPLOYER-PROVIDED  PLAN WE KEEP OUR PLANS. FOR SOME OF US WHO HAD PLANS IN  2010 WHEN THE LAW WAS ENACTED WE KEEP OUR PLAN BECAUSE THEY WERE  GRANDFATHERED IN BECAUSE THEY  MEET MINIMUM STANDARDS. WHAT CHANGES IS THAT FOR PEOPLE  WHO HAD PLANS THAT DIDN&#39;T MEET  MINIMUM STANDARDS THEY WILL GET  UPGRADED PLANS. THEIR INSURERS WILL PROVIDE THEM FOR THEM. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOW TODAY THE PRESIDENT  TALKED ABOUT HOW ENROLLMENT WAS  INITIALLY SLOW FOR THE  MASSACHUSETTS HEALTH CARE PLAN. HE SAID JUST 123 PEOPLE ENROLLED IN THE FIRST MONTH. BUT MORE THAN 36,000 SIGNED ON  BY THE END OF THE YEAR-LONG  ENROLLMENT PERIOD. SO EVEN THE ROMNEY PLAN HAD SOME BUMPS IN THE ROAD EARLY IN ITS  GOING INTO EFFECT AND PICKED UP  OVER TIME. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YEAH. AL, THIS IS A HARD THING TO DO. IT&#39;S A BIG LIFT. YOU&#39;RE TRYING TO TRANSFORM A LOT OF PEOPLE&#39;S LIVES IN A POOSTIVE  WAY, BUT THAT INVOLVES WORK AND  IT WAS A SLOW RAMP UP. AS YOU SAID, AT THE START, 123  PEOPLE.

BUT REPUBLICANS DIDN&#39;T CARE  ABOUT THAT. THEY JUST WANTED TO POINT  FINGERS AND PLAY GAMES. AND SINCE SECRETARY SEBELIUS IS  FROM KANSAS. THEY SEEM TO THINK IT WOULD JUST BE HILARIOUS IF THEY MADE A  BUNCH OF JOKES ABOUT THE WIZARD  OF OZ. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; MADAM SECRETARY, WHILE YOU&#39;RE FROM KANSAS, WE&#39;RE NOT IN KANSAS ANYMORE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THOSE FOLKS WORKED AWFUL HARD TO GO DOWN THAT YELLOW BRICK  ROAD. AS WE GO, IT&#39;S NOT WHAT PEOPLE  HAVE WORKED THEIR WAY TO. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SOME WOULD SAY WE WERE IN THE WIZARD OF OZ LAND CONSIDERING  THE PARALLEL UNIVERSES WE APPEAR TO BE HAB STATING. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; REPUBLICANS WANT TO TURN THE  SECRETARY INTO THE WICKED GLITCH OF THE WEST. AND WHILE THEY WANT TO CLICK  THEIR HEELS THREE TIMES AND MAKE THIS LAW GO AWAY, IT&#39;S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. THESE REPUBLICANS KNOW THEY  CAN&#39;T CHANGE THE LAW. SO THEY DECIDED TO GET UGLY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHY AREN&#39;T YOU LOSING YOUR  INSURANCE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU PROMISED THIS WOULD BE  READY ON OCTOBER 1. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THIS,  MADAM SECRETARY? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S NOT AN ANSWER. THAT&#39;S NOT A YES OR NO. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BUT THIS WASN&#39;T REALLY ABOUT  ATTACKING THE WEBSITE OR EVEN  ATTACKING THE SECRETARY. IF YOU FOLLOW THIS YELLOW BRICK  ROAD ALL THE WAY, YOU CAN SEE  THAT IT&#39;S REALLY ABOUT ATTACKING THE PRESIDENT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHO IS ULTIMATELY  RESPONSIBLE? IT IS THE PRESIDENT, CORRECT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; FOR THE WEBSITE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE PRESIDENT, THE PRESIDENT  IS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR  THE ROLLOUT, ULTIMATELY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NO, SIR. NO, SIR. WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE  ROLLO ROLLOUT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, THE PRESIDENT IS  ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE. WHILE I THINK IT&#39;S A GREAT THAT  YOU&#39;RE A TEAM PLAYER AND YOU&#39;RE  TAKING RESPONSIBILITY, IT&#39;S THE  PRESIDENT&#39;S ULTIMATE  RESPONSIBILITY, CORRECT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CLEARLY -- WHATEVER. YES, HE IS THE PRESIDENT. HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHATEVER IS RIGHT. IT&#39;S NOT EVEN WORTH ENGAGING  THESE RIGHT-WING CRITICS. BECAUSE THEY&#39;RE NOT SERIOUS. THEY&#39;RE JUST NOT SERIOUS. THEY DID EVERYTHING THEY COULD  TO UNDERMINE THE LAW. AND NOW THEY&#39;RE PRETENDING TO BE UPSET WHEN THE LAW SHOWS ANY  SIGN OF TROUBLE. IF ONLY THEY HAD THE BRAINS, THE HEART AND THE COURAGE TO ADMIT  IT. JOINING ME NOW IS CONGRESSMAN  JOHN YASH MUT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I WISH I&#39;D WRITTEN THAT  INTRO. THAT WAS A BRILLIANT INTRO. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WERE REPUBLICANS INTERESTED  IN LEARNING WHAT&#39;S ACTUALLY  GOING ON WITH THIS LAW? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NO. ALL THEY&#39;RE TRYING TO DO IS  SUSTAIN THIS NARRATIVE THAT THIS IS BAD FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE  AND THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA IS A  SOCIALIST. IT HASN&#39;T WORKED SO FAR. IT&#39;S NOT GOING TO WORK NOW. WHAT&#39;S WONDERFUL ABOUT THE  CONTROVERSY OVER THE LAST FEW  WEEKS IS THAT THE POPULARITY OF  THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT HAS  INCREASED IN THE POLLS. IN MY STATE, WE HAVE LITERALLY  30, OVER 30,000 PEOPLE HAVE  ALREADY ENROLLED IN COVERAGE WHO WOULD NEVER HAVE HAD COVERAGE  BEFORE. WE HAVE 350,000 PEOPLE WHO ARE  EXPLORING COVERAGE IN OUR  EXCHANGE. SO THINGS ARE GOING WELL IN MANY PA PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. AND AS SOON AS WE GET THESE  GLITCHES ROLLED OUT THEY&#39;RE  GOING TO GO WELL NATIONALLY. AND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO REALIZE  HOW GREAT THIS IS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; MITCH McCONNELL TRIED TO MAKE IT SEEM AS IF HE WAS SAD ABOUT  GLITCHES IN OBAMA CARE. LISTEN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I WISH THE PRESIDENT AND  WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS HAD  LISTENED BACK THEN. I REALLY DO. I WISH WE&#39;D BEEN WRONG ABOUT  OBAMA CARE TOO, BUT BECAUSE OF  THE FAILINGS OF THIS LAW ARE  ABOUT SO MUCH MORE THAN A  WEBSITE, IT REALLY ABOUT REAL  PEOPLE. P.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HE TRIED TO MAKE THE LAW  FAIL, NOW HE WISHES THEY WERE  WRONG ABOUT IT. DOESN&#39;T SEEM LIKE THEY&#39;RE WRONG  IN KENTUCKY, CONGRESSMAN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NO. MITCH IS IN A VERY DIFFICULT  SPOT IN KENTUCKY. AGAIN, INCREDIBLE RESPONSE TO  THE PROGRAM. OUR EXCHANGES WORK VERY WELL. THE GOVERNOR&#39;S EMBRACED IT. AND WE&#39;RE HAVING JUST A  REMARKABLE RESPONSE. AND PEOPLE ARE NOW WAKING UP TO  THE FACT THAT FOR THE LAST THREE AND A HALF YEARS MITCH  McCONNELL&#39;S BEEN LYING TO THEM  ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT  AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR THEM. SO HE&#39;S GOING TO PAY FOR THIS  NEXT ELECTION DAY, BUT HIS  CROCODILE TEARS AREN&#39;T GOING TO  IMPRESS EVERYBODY. EVERYBODY KNOWS THE REPUBLICANS  NEVER WANTED TO BE PART OF THIS, NEVER WANTED TO OWN ANY PART OF  IT, NEVER WANTED TO PROVIDE  HEALTH CARE FOR THE AMERICAN  CITIZENS. THEY WERE IN CONTROL OF CONGRESS FOR A LONG TIME. AND ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS  EXISTED, HIGHER PREMIUMS, ALL  THE BRANG RUNSIES AND SO FORTH. THEY EXISTED WHEN THEY WERE IN  CONTROL AND THEY NEVER DID A  THING ABOUT IT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ONE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES MADE A STRANGE REQUEST IN THE HEARING  TODAY. HERE IS CONGRESSMAN OF COLORADO. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I WOULD LIKE TO SUBMIT A  WAIVER FROM MY DISTRICT FOR  OBAMA CARE AND HOPE THAT YOU  WOULD CONSIDER WAIVING OBAMA  CARE FOR THE FOURTH  CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HE WANTS TO EXEMPT HIS  DISTRICT FROM THE LAW. BUT MORE THAN 102,000 PEOPLE IN  HIS DISTRICT ARE UNINSURED. SO HE WANTS TO STOP THEM FROM  GETTING COVERAGE OR GETTING  BENEFITS LIKE FREE PREVENTIVE  CARE AND CHEAPER PRESCRIPTIONS. IT&#39;S OUTRAGEOUS ON THE FACE OF  IT, CONGRESSMAN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; OF COURSE IT IS. AND THEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE LIKE  HIM IN TEXAS LIKE TED CRUZ. TEXAS HAS THE LARGEST NUMBER OF  UNINSURED. YOU CAN&#39;T EVEN QUALIFY FOR  MEDICAID. IT&#39;S JUST OUTRAGEOUS.","media$content":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":412.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":0,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/8B0JWRk5VgPS?feed=PoliticsNation","plfile$width":0,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":500000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":412.079,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":240,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/JdNje1DyaPUt?feed=PoliticsNation","plfile$width":420,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":800000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":412.079,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":360,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/FqPsk183ujcE?feed=PoliticsNation","plfile$width":640,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"media$thumbnails":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"image","plfile$duration":0.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"JPEG","plfile$height":1080,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Sections/TVNews/MSNBC%20TV/PHOTOS%20-%20AMY/Sharpton/_l2a4347_2.jpg","plfile$width":1920,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"image","plfile$duration":0.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"JPEG","plfile$height":1080,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_sharp_2cong_131030.jpg","plfile$width":1920,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"link":"","pubDate":1383175860000,"plmedia$defaultThumbnailUrl":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_sharp_2cong_131030.jpg","nnd$associatedPlaylist":{"href":"http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_44263878"},"nnd$brand":"MSNBC","nnd$bureau":"30RockNY","nnd$bviAssetId":"n_sharp_2cong_131030","nnd$canonicalUrl":{"href":"http://www.msnbc.com/politicsnation/watch/the-gops-glitch-hunt-58736195911"},"nnd$distributionProfile":["MSN-CA","AWE"],"nnd$firstAiredAtUtc":1383171300000,"nnd$lastAiredAtUtc":1383171300000,"nnd$lastEditorialChangeAtUtc":1383316466000,"nnd$longTitle":"The GOP’s glitch hunt","nnd$playCount30":4808,"nnd$playCountDay":71,"nnd$playCountYear":4822,"nnd$requiresCaptioning":true,"nnd$shortDescription":"Rep.

TED CRUZ WAS ASKED IF PRESIDENT  OBAMA IS LIKE CUBAN DICTATOR FID FIDEL CASTRO. HE ADMITTED THERE&#39;S SOME  DIFFERENCES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK HE IS ABSOLUTELY  ABUSING HIS POWER. AND YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO  SAYS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER  CONGRESS ACTS, I&#39;M GOING TO  FORCE MY WILL ON THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE. THAT&#39;S NOT CONSISTENT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ABUSING HIS POWER? THE PARTY WHO HELD THIS COUNTRY  HOSTAGE IS TALKING ABOUT ABUSE  OF POWER? THIS ISN&#39;T ABOUT POLICY. THIS&#39;S ABOUT DEMONIZING THE  PRESIDENT. HE&#39;S A TYRANT, A COMMUNIST, A  DICTATOR. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IN AN EFFORT TO SPEAK --  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I AM NOT GOING TO TAKE THE  THUGGERY OF THIS PRESIDENT MUCH  LONGER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HE HAS ALL THE EARMARKS OF A  MARXIST DICTATE IR. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WATCHING A DICTATORSHIP  EMERGE IN FRONT OF THEIR EYES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IN EVERY SOCIETY AND CULTURE  WHERE DICTATORS TAKE OVER, ONE  OF THE THINGS THEY HAVE TO DO IS MAKE SURE THE CITIZENS ARE  DISARMED AND CAN&#39;T FIGHT IN THE  STREETS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; KNOWING WHO HE IS, KNOWING  THE KIND OF AUTHORITARIAN  QUASIDICTATOR MENTALITY HE HAS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; QUASI DICTATOR MENTALITY. THAT&#39;S WHY WE SEE TED CRUZ AGAIN TODAY ATTACKING OBAMA CARE. WE KNOW WHAT IT&#39;S REALLY ABOUT. IT&#39;S NOT ABOUT THE POLICY. IT&#39;S ABOUT THE PRESIDENT. JOINING ME NOW ARE KAREN FINNEY  AND ABBEY HUNTSMAN. THANKS FOR COMING ON THE SHOW  TONIGHT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THANKS, REV. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; KAREN, TED CRUZ IS TALKING  ABOUT ABUSE OF POWER. WHAT&#39;S BEHIND THIS? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, THIS IS A MIEN THE  REPUBLICANS STARTED. HE&#39;S A CONSTITUTIONAL LAW  PROFESSOR SO THEY SAY HE&#39;S  TRYING TO SKIRT THE CONSTITUTION AND HE&#39;S THIS DICTATOR. PART OF THAT I THINK IS ABOUT  INCITING THEIR AUDIENCE, RIGHT,  AND RILING UP THEIR AUDIENCE  BECAUSE THAT SORT OF TEA PAERKTS WE&#39;RE FIGHTING THIS EVIL DICTATE IRLANGUAGE, IT&#39;S VERY BOMB BASS  PARTICULAR. ANT OTHER THING HE LIKES TO DO  IS USE APOCALYPTIC LANGUAGE AS  WELL. THAT THE AID FORDABLE CARE ACT  IS THE END OF DAYS. IT&#39;S DRAMATIC LANGUAGE THAT THEY LIKE TO USE. AND THAT IS BOTH ABOUT  DEMONIZING THE PRESIDENT,  ACTIVATING THE BASE AND RAISING  MONEY, QUITE FRANKLY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE PRESIDENT WAS ACCUSED OF  FAILING TO RESPECT THE RULE OF  LAW. LISTEN TO THIS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT  RESPECTED RULE OF LAW. AND HAS CONSISTENTLY FLOUTED THE CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITS ON THE  AUTHORITY OF THE PRESIDENT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOW, ABBEY, I MIGHT HAVE  MISSED SOMETHING, BUT I THOUGHT  THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS LAW, AND I THOUGHT THE SUPREME COURT  UPHELD THAT IT WAS  CONSTITUTIONAL. SO HE COULDN&#39;T HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND I&#39;M PRETTY SURE TED CRUZ  KNOWS THAT HIMSELF. HE&#39;S A VERY SMART MAN. OPINIONS ARE OPINION. BUT YOU CAN&#39;T DISPUTE THE FACTS. IF YOU LOOK AT THE DEFINITION OF WHAT A DICTATOR IS, IT&#39;S SOMEONE WHO DOES NOT RULE BY DEMOCRATIC  MINES. IF YOU LOOK AT OBAMA CARE, IT  WAS PASSED THROUGH DEMOCRATIC  MEANS. IT PASSED THROUGH THE CONGRESS. IT PASSED THE SUPREME COURT. SO HE&#39;S GOING TO HAVE TO WAKE UP IN REALITY ONE OF THESE DAYS AND REALIZE THAT THIS IS THE LAW. NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES HE  TRIES TO REPEAL IT, THIS IS THE  WAY IT&#39;S GOING TO BE AND IT&#39;S  ALREADY IN EFFECT. THIS IS A MAN WHO MAKES ME BOIL. HE&#39;S MADE A NAME FOR HIMSELF IN  THE SENATE AS BEING A COMPLETE  PHONY. HE HAS NO PLATFORM, NO AGENDA. IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT HE WAS  ELECTED TO DO AND WHAT HE&#39;S DONE SO FAR, THE ONLY THING I CAN  THINK OF IS FILIBUSTERING A BILL HE KNEW WOULD NOT GET REPEALED  IN A QUASI 24 HOUR FILIBUSTER. HE MAKES ME INCREDIBLY UPSET  BECAUSE HE HAS A MICROPHONE FOR  THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. IT&#39;S NO QUESTION YOU&#39;RE SEEING  LOW POLL NUMBERS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AS ABBEY SAYS, WE CAN HAVE  DIFFERENT OPINIONS, NOT  DIFFERENT FACTS. LET&#39;S GET THE FACTS. IN PRESIDENT BUSH&#39;S FIRST FIVE  YEARS OF OFFICE, HE ISSUED 197  EXECUTIVE ORDERS. IN PRESIDENT OBAMA&#39;S FIRST FIVE  YEARS IN OFFICE, HE&#39;S ISSUED  ONLY 163 EXECUTIVE ORDERS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; MM-HM. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND THEY WANT TO PORTRAY  PRESIDENT OBAMA AS A DICTATOR? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, HOW ABOUT GEORGE W.  BUSH LIED US INTO A LAW  THWARTING CONGRESS THAT YEARS  LATER WE STILL HAVE MEN AND  WOMEN DYING IN AFGHANISTAN. IF WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHO&#39;S A DICTATOR WE NEED TO LOOK AT  THAT. TED CRUZ, IF HE WOULD READ THE  CONSTITUTION, A LOT OF WHAT HE  PREACHES IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH  WHAT THE FOUNDERS INTENDED IN  WRITING THE CONSTITUTION. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, YOU&#39;VE BEEN  OUTSPOKEN, ABBEY, AND SOME OTHER REPUBLICANS ARE NOW CALLING OUT  TID CRUZ, THE GOP CALLED OUT  SCOTT RIDGELL. AND I THINK THAT THERE CAN BE  REPUBLICANS. YOU AND I HAVE HAD THIS  DISCUSSION. I THINK IT&#39;S HEALTHY TO HAVE A  TWO-PARTY SYSTEM, BUT WHEN  YOU&#39;RE DEALING WITH NO PROGRAMS, ALL BOMBASTING, PERSONAL  ATTACKS, IT DOES A DISSERVICE TO THOSE WHO REALLY HAVE SOME  SUBSTANTIVE DISAGREEMENTS WITH  THE PRESIDENT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU EVEN HAVE SANTORUM. HE CAME OUT AND SAID THIS GUY IS HURTING THE PARTY. YOU LOOK AT OBAMA CARE WITH THE  WEBSITE GLITCHES YOU WOULD THINK THIS WOULD BE A BLESSING FOR  REPUBLICANS. IT MASKS THEIR IDENTIFY LONG CAL STRUGGLES AND ALLOWS THEM TO  TAKE SOME CONTROL OF THE  NARRATIVE AND MAYBE PUT FORWARD  SOME IDEAS OF THEIR OWN,  INSTEAD, THOUGH, THEY CONTINUE  TO LITIGATE THE PAST, WHICH IS  REALLY SAD, BECAUSE THIS AN  OPPORTUNITY FOR REPUBLICANS TO  TAKE HOLD AGAIN. I MEAN THE PUBLIC IS NOT HAPPY  WITH THE WEBSITE. THIS IS REALLY A CHANCE FOR  THEM, AND INSTEAD THEY HARP BACK ON THE OLD RHETORIC. YOU&#39;RE LISTENING TO CRUZ. IT&#39;S EMBARRASSING, AND I THINK  THE PARTY DESERVES MORE THAN  THIS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; DOES THE OVERREACH HARM  PRESIDENT OBAMA? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT FURTHER DISCREDITS TED  CRUZ THAT IT IS SUCH BOMB BASS  PARTICULAR RHETORIC. I DON&#39;T THINK ANYBODY SEES THE  PRESIDENT ABUSING HIS POWER. HOW ABOUT SYRIA? HE SAYS I WILL GO TO CONGRESS. WHEN THEY MAKE THOSE CHARGES IT  DOES REDUCE THEIR CREDIBILITY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IN MANY CASE PROGRESSIVES AND PEOPLE ON THE LEFT THOUGHT THE  PRESIDENT WOULD ALWAYS GO FOR  COMPROMISE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE OF  A DICTATE OR. THEY WANTED HIM TO SEIZE MORE  POWER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, ABBEY, WHEN YOU  LOOK AT THE FACT THAT TED CRUZ  TODAY STARTED GOING AFTER  HILLARY CLINTON WITH THE FEAR  MONGERING AND HE SAID I&#39;M NOT  GOING, HE TALKED ABOUT IMAGINE  WHAT HILLARY CLINTON WOULD DO. IS HE NOW TRYING TO SHOOT TO A  2016 ARGUMENT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S BEEN THE PLAN THE  WHOLE TIME. AT LEAST THAT&#39;S WHAT IT APPEARS  LIKE. AND, YOU KNOW, I DON&#39;T FLOW KNOW IF  YOU&#39;VE HEARD, BUT HE&#39;S GOING TO  BE ON JAY LENO. HE&#39;S LOVING EVERY BIT OF IT. HE&#39;S LOVING THE ROLLOUT OF OBAMA CARE AND THE COMPLICATIONS. IT&#39;S NOT AT ALL ABOUT THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE, WHAT&#39;S BEST FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. IT&#39;S ALL ABOUT HIM, ALL ABOUT  THIS GUY. IT MAKES ME ANGRY. AND I THINK IT MAKES A NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS ANGRY THAT DO WANT A POSITIVE FUTURE FOR THE PARTY  AND A POSITIVE FUTURE FOR THE  COUNTRY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IF TED CRUZ THINKS CAN HE  TAKE ON HILLARY CLINTON, I SAY  GAME ON. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT WOULD BE ENTERTAINING. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I&#39;M GOING TO HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TONIGHT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt;&gt; AHEAD, ADVANCING THE DREAM  WITH THE STORY OF GAINING SKILLS","media$content":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":800000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":550.784,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":360,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/ceU5J_7SVhO3?feed=PoliticsNation","plfile$width":640,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":500000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":550.784,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":240,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/azOZJjm5PK38?feed=PoliticsNation","plfile$width":420,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":550.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":0,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/weASMlHUujXj?feed=PoliticsNation","plfile$width":0,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"media$thumbnails":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"image","plfile$duration":0.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"JPEG","plfile$height":1080,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_sharp_4pow_131030.jpg","plfile$width":1920,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"link":"","pubDate":1383175680000,"plmedia$defaultThumbnailUrl":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_sharp_4pow_131030.jpg","nnd$associatedPlaylist":{"href":"http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_44263878"},"nnd$brand":"MSNBC","nnd$bureau":"30RockNY","nnd$bviAssetId":"n_sharp_4pow_131030","nnd$canonicalUrl":{"href":"http://www.msnbc.com/politicsnation/watch/ted-cruz-abuses-the-facts-58742339530"},"nnd$distributionProfile":["MSN-CA","AWE"],"nnd$firstAiredAtUtc":1383172432000,"nnd$lastAiredAtUtc":1383172432000,"nnd$lastEditorialChangeAtUtc":1383316465000,"nnd$longTitle":"Ted Cruz abuses the facts","nnd$playCount30":4224,"nnd$playCountDay":66,"nnd$playCountYear":4234,"nnd$requiresCaptioning":true,"nnd$shortDescription":"As Sen.

THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS FALLEN TO 7.2%. THAT&#39;S ABOUT 11.3 MILLION  AMERICANS. BUT THERE ARE MORE THAN 3  MILLION OPEN JOBS OUT THERE  RIGHT NOW. THAT DOESN&#39;T MAKE SENSE, RIGHT? MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO NEED JOBS AT THE SAME TIME MILLIONS OF  JOBS ARE AVAILABLE. TURNS OUT THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY. THE BIGGEST IS THE SKILLS GAP. NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE WITH THE  SKILLS TO DO THOSE OPEN JOBS. THAT&#39;S WHY WE MUST COME TOGETHER TO FIND SMART ANSWERS, INCLUDING RETRAINING WORKERS AND PROVIDING EDUCATION LATER IN LIFE. THE GOOD NEWS IS THERE ARE  PLACES WHERE THIS IMPORTANT WORK IS ALREADY BEING DONE. IN PHILADELPHIA, THEY&#39;RE  CONFRONTING THE PROBLEM HEAD ON  WITH A PROGRAM THAT IS GIVING  PEOPLE NEW SKILLS AND NEW HOPE. SO TONIGHT WE BEGIN A NEW  PHASE-IN OUR ADVANCING THE DREAM SERIES WITH THE FOCUS ON  TRAINING, ON EDUCATION, ON  FINDING COMMON GROUND TO CLOSE  THAT SKILLS GAP. JOINING ME NOW ARE SHEILA  IRELAND, DIRECTOR OF THE PROGRAM I JUST MENTIONED, THE WEST  PHILADELPHIA SKILLS INITIATIVE  AND JOYCE BACON WHO&#39;S  PARTICIPATED IN THE PROGRAM. THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SHEILA, YOU&#39;RE ABLE TO REALLY HELP PEOPLE GET SKILLS AND GET  THE JOBS THAT THEY NEED. HOW? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, OVER THE TIME THAT  WE&#39;VE BEEN ABLE TO BE DOING THE  WEST PHILADELPHIA SKILLS  INITIATIVE, WHAT WE&#39;VE COME TO  UNDERSTAND IS, IS THAT IN WEST  PHILADELPHIA SPECIFICALLY, WE&#39;VE BEEN MINING LOCAL GOLD. THERE&#39;S TALENT IN THIS RANKS OF  UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE THAT YOU&#39;RE  TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE  SKILLS GAP. AND WHAT WE&#39;RE ABLE TO DO IS TO  PROVIDE THE CONNECTION TO MAJOR  INSTITUTIONAL EMPLOYERS. BY HAVING A PROGRAM THAT PUTS  THE JOB FIRST AND GIVES US THE  CAPABILITY TO REALLY TRAIN  PEOPLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE  OCCUPATION THAT THEY&#39;VE CHOSEN  TO COMPETE FOR, WE&#39;RE ABLE TO  EFFECTIVELY CONNECT THEM TO  WORK. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, JOYCE, YOU WENT THROUGH THE PROGRAM. TELL US.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YES, I DID. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IN PLAIN LANGUAGE, WHAT THAT  PROGRAM MEANT FOR YOU. YOU&#39;RE A MOTHER OF FOUR I  UNDERSTAND. WHAT HAS THIS MEANT TO YOU. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THIS IS A DYNAMIC PROGRAM. NOT ONLY DO THEY GIVE YOU THE  SOFT SKILLS TO GET AND MAINTAIN  EMPLOYMENT BUT THEY GIVE YOU  THAT DOOR OF OPPORTUNITY AT THE  END BY CONNECTING YOU WITH THE  EMPLOYER. I&#39;M CURRENTLY EMPLOYED AT  CHILDREN&#39;S HOSPITAL OF  PHILADELPHIA, ONE OF THE MOST  PRESTIGIOUS HOSPITALS IN THE  NATION. AND AFTER GOING THROUGH THE  PROGRAM, GAINING THE NECESSARY  SKILLS AND JUST ENHANCING SOME  OF THE SKILLS I ALREADY HAD AND  JUST GIVING ME THE BOOST OF  CONFIDENCE TO, ONCE I GOT TO  THAT INTERVIEW, JUST BEING ABLE  TO WALK THROUGH THAT DOOR AND  HAVING THE CONFIDENCE TO DO  THAT, YOU KNOW, I&#39;M NOW WORKING  FOR THIS AWESOME INSTITUTION. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LET ME PUT YOU ON THE SPOT. DO YOU THINK YOU COULD HAVE  LANDED THAT JOB WITHOUT THIS  PROGRAM? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I MUST SAY WITH INSTITUTION  LIKE CHILDREN&#39;S HOSPITAL, NO. WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY CONNECTED ME. THEY GAVE ME THAT OPEN DOOR. AND THEY ENHANCED MY SKILLS. AND ONCE THAT DOOR WAS OPEN WITH THE CONNECTION, WITH THE  EMPLOYER AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE INTERVIEW WITH THE EMPLOYER, YOU KNOW,LY TO GO THROUGH THAT  DOOR WITH THOSE SKILLS THAT I,  YOU KNOW, THAT I GAINED FROM THE WEST PHILADELPHIA SKILLS  INITIATIVE PROGRAM AND GAIN THAT OPPORTUNITY. NOW ME, ON MY OWN, I COULD HAVE  SUBMITTED RESUMES AND APPLIED  FOR JOBS ONLINE. BUT GETTING THAT INTERVIEW IS  WHAT&#39;S IMPORTANT. AND I DON&#39;T THINK I WOULD HAVE  BEEN ABLE TO SCORE THAT  INTERVIEW AS QUICKLY ON MY OWN  AS I WAS ABLE TO DO WITH THE  WEST PHILADELPHIA INITIATIVE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND I UNDERSTAND NOW THAT  YOU&#39;RE GOING FOR A BA DEGREE IN  PSYCHOLOGY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SHEILA, THIS REALLY GOES  AGAINST THE GRAIN THAT SO MANY  PEOPLE ARE ASCRIBED TO OF SAYING THAT PEOPLE DON&#39;T WANT TO WORK. PEOPLE WANT TO WORK. THEY NEED SOME KIND OF WAY TO BE CONNECTED, TO BE TRAINED AND  PREPARED. AND I THINK THIS IS WHAT YOUR  GROUP THERE, YOUR INITIATIVE  THERE IS TRYING TO DO. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S ABSOLUTELY TRUE. IT IS OUR EXPERIENCE WITH THE  PARTICIPANTS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR PROGRAMS THAT IT&#39;S THE SMALL,  SOFT SKILLS GAPS THAT ACTUALLY  PREVENT THE CONNECTION TO WORK. IT&#39;S NOT THAT PEOPLE DON&#39;T WANT  TO WORK. IT&#39;S NOT THAT PEOPLE DON&#39;T WANT  TO HAVE GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT. IT&#39;S THAT SOMETIMES THE ISSUES  THAT THEY HAVE THAT PREVENT THEM FROM BEING CONNECTED TO  EMPLOYMENT CAN BE TERRIBLY  OPAQUE TO THEM. SO WHAT WE DO IS HELP THEM  EVALUATE WHAT IT IS THEY WANT TO DO, HOW IT IS THEY WANT TO GO  ABOUT DOING IT, GIVE THEM THE  CONFIDENCE TO DO SO AND GIVE  THEM A LITTLE PUSH TOWARDS THAT  DOOR THAT WE&#39;VE OPENED WITH THE  EMPLOYERS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, WHERE DO YOU SEE YOUR  CAREER GOING, JOYCE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, I ABSOLUTELY LOVE  WORKING WITH THE CHILDREN THERE  AT CHILDREN&#39;S HOSPITAL. I&#39;M WORKING TOWARDS, LIKE YOU  MENTIONED, I&#39;M WORKING TOWARD MY DEGREE IN PSYCHOLOGY. SO I THINK I&#39;M GOING TO BE, YOU  KNOW, WORKING IN CHILD AND  ADOLESCENT PSYCHOLOGY IN THE  FUTURE. RIGHT NOW I&#39;M JUST LOVING THE,  YOU KNOW, JUST WORKING FOR SUCH  A DYNAMIC INSTITUTION AND BEING  ABLE TO LEARN SO MUCH. YOU KNOW, I STARTED THE PROGRAM  IN APRIL -- I MEAN I STARTED  WORKING THERE IN APRIL AS A  PATIENT SITTER, ONE ON ONE  INDIVIDUAL THERE FOR PATIENT  SAFETY. AND I&#39;VE BEEN RECENTLY PROMOTED  TO INPATIENT CLERK. SO I&#39;M JUST EXCITED ABOUT THE  OPPORTUNITY, I&#39;M THANKFUL TO THE WEST PHILADELPHIA INITIATIVE  SKILLS PROGRAM BECAUSE WITHOUT  THAT PUSH THAT MS. IRELAND  MENTIONED IT JUST WOULD HAVE  BEEN KIND OF HARD GETTING IN  SUCH AN INSTITUTION. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR TIME  THIS EVENING. AND WE WILL KEEL P UP WITH YOU AND YOUR PROGRAM. LET ME SAY, THE REASON WHY WE  ARE DOING THESE SEGMENTS ABOUT  SKILLS GAP IN ADVANCING THE  DREAM IS THAT THERE ARE TENS  UP UPON THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OUT  THERE JUST LIKE JOYCE THAT JUST  NEED THAT PUSH, THAT JUST NEEDS  THAT SKILLS TRAINING. THEY ARE NOT SITTING AROUND,  LAZY AND WATCHING BIG SCREEN  TVS. THEY JUST NEED A PUSH. THEY JUST NEED A LITTLE SKILLS  TRAINING. AND THEY CAN MAKE A PRODUCTIVE  CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY AND THEM SELVES. WE&#39;RE GOING TO PUT A SPOTLIGHT  ON THEM. WE NEED TO MOVE THIS COUNTRY  FORWARD SO THAT EVERYONE&#39;S DREAM BECOMES PART OF AMERICA MAKING  THE AMERICAN DREAM A REALITY.","media$content":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":500000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":423.824,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":240,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/KORsyJelh47f?feed=PoliticsNation","plfile$width":420,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":800000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":423.824,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":360,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/znc6rGhD855Q?feed=PoliticsNation","plfile$width":640,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":423.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":0,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/ypvBqQJ7L7tD?feed=PoliticsNation","plfile$width":0,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"media$thumbnails":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"image","plfile$duration":0.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"JPEG","plfile$height":1080,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_sharp_5dream_131030.jpg","plfile$width":1920,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"link":"","pubDate":1383175620000,"plmedia$defaultThumbnailUrl":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_sharp_5dream_131030.jpg","nnd$associatedPlaylist":{"href":"http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_44263878"},"nnd$brand":"MSNBC","nnd$bureau":"30RockNY","nnd$bviAssetId":"n_sharp_5dream_131030","nnd$canonicalUrl":{"href":"http://www.msnbc.com/politicsnation/watch/shrinking-the-skills-gap-58742339507"},"nnd$distributionProfile":["MSN-CA","AWE"],"nnd$firstAiredAtUtc":1383173194000,"nnd$lastAiredAtUtc":1383173194000,"nnd$lastEditorialChangeAtUtc":1383316470000,"nnd$longTitle":"Shrinking the 'skills gap'","nnd$playCount30":3458,"nnd$playCountDay":82,"nnd$playCountYear":3472,"nnd$requiresCaptioning":true,"nnd$shortDescription":"Millions of Americans are looking for work, but at least 3 million jobs are open.

TONIGHT&#39;S LEAD, THE TRUTH ABOUT  THE GOP EFFORT TO KILL OBAMA  CARE. IT&#39;S NOT REALLY ABOUT THE HEALTH CARE WEBSITE. IT&#39;S ABOUT THE ENTIRE LAW. TODAY REPUBLICAN LEADERS MADE  THAT CLEAR. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, THE PROBLEM WITH  OBAMA CARE ISN&#39;T JUST THE  WEBSITE. IT&#39;S THE WHOLE LAW. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE  PROBLEMS WITH OBAMA CARE RUN  DEEPER THAN JUST THE WEBSITE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HEAR THAT? THIS ISN&#39;T ABOUT THE WEBSITE  GLITCHES. IT&#39;S ABOUT SCRAPPING THE WHOLE  THING. NEVER MIND THAT 17 MILLION  CHILDREN WITH PRE-EXISTING  CONDITIONS ARE NOW COVERED. NEVER MIND THAT INSURANCE  PREMIUMS ARE 16% LOWER THAN  EXPECTED. THE GOP WANTS ALL THIS TO WITHER ON THE VINE. AND THEY&#39;RE OFFERING NO  ALTERNATIVES OF THEIR OWN. AND TODAY DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN BILL PASQUEL CALLED THEM OUT ON  IT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; INCLUDING THE ONE I&#39;M THE COO SPONSOR OF. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ARE YOU SERIOUS WHAT YOU JUST SAID? ARE YOU REALLY SERIOUS? AFTER WHAT WE HAVE GONE THROUGH  AND WHAT WE HAVE GONE THROUGH IN THE LAST THREE AND A HALF YEARS. YOU CAN SIT THERE AND SAY THAT  YOU HAD A LEGITIMATE ALTERNATIVE AFTER THESE YEARS? WE&#39;VE GONE THROUGH 44 VOTES, 48  VOTES NOW, OF YOU TRYING TO  DISMANTLE THE LEGISLATION. YOU CALL THAT COOPERATION? I DON&#39;T. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WOW. THAT&#39;S AN AMAZING MOMENT. THIS LAW IS IMPORTANT. IT&#39;S SAVING LIVES. AND YET THE SPEND FROM THE RIGHT IS LITERALLY LAUGHABLE. WANT TO KNOW WHO RUPERT  MURDOCH&#39;S WALL STREET JOURNAL IS PAWNING OFF AS A HEALTH EXPERT. HERE&#39;S A HINT. * * COME AND KNOCK ON OUR DOOR  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SUZANNE SOMMERS. YOU KNOW HER. SHE WAS ON THE OLD TV SHOW  &quot;THREE&#39;S COMPANY.&quot; FROM THERE SHE BECAME KNOWN FOR  HER FAMOUS THIGH MASTER  INFOMERCIALS. AND NOW SHE&#39;S A RIGHT WING  AUTHORITY ON HEALTH CARE WRITING OP-EDS FOR THE WALL STREET  JOURNAL. SEE THERE? SHE&#39;S ONE OF THE, QUOTE,  EXPERTS. AND HER ARTICLE CLAIMS THE  AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS A  SOCIALIST PONZI SCHEME. OF COURSE, THAT&#39;S NOT TRUE. AND IN FACT, THERE WERE SO MANY  THINGS WRONG IN HER ARTICLE THAT THE PAPER HAD TO ISSUE  CORRECTION AFTER CORRECTION  AFTER CORRECTION. BUT WE&#39;RE USED TO HEARING BOGUS  FACTS FROM THE RIGHT WING. IN FACT, MAYBE TED CRUZ, SPEAKER BOEHNER, AND SUZANNE SOMERS  SHOULD GET TOGETHER. I HEAR THEY&#39;RE LOOKING TO REMAKE &quot;THREE&#39;S COMPANY.&quot; JOINING ME NOW IS CONGRESSMAN  EMANUEL CLEAVER AND MSNBC  CONTRIBUTOR GOLDIE TAYLOR. CONGRESSMAN CLEAVER, THIS  CURRENT CRUSADE ISN&#39;T ABOUT THE  GLITCHES ANYMORE, IS IT? IT&#39;S ABOUT KILLING THE WHOLE  LAW, ISN&#39;T IT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YEAH. IT&#39;S THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF  HYPOCRISY THAT I&#39;VE SEEN SINCE  I&#39;VE BEEN HERE, ALMOST TEN  YEARS. TO SIT AT A COMMITTEE HEARING  AND HEAR PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT  THE GLITCHES WITH THE ENROLLMENT IS JUST UNBELIEVABLE, BECAUSE  THEY&#39;RE NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THE  GLITCHES. THEY&#39;RE NOT CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE THE ENROLLMENT BETTER. THEY ARE JUST TRYING TO  CRITICIZE THIS AND GET MORE  PEOPLE TURNED OFF. BUT IT IS HYPOCRISY AT THE  HIGHEST LEVEL. THE WORST PART ABOUT IT IS  THEY&#39;RE NOT EMBARRASSED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOW -- AND, YOU KNOW, GOLDIE, PEOPLE ARE HAVING TROUBLE ON THE NEW EXCHANGES. BUT BY REFUSING TO EXPAND  MEDICAID, SOME REPUBLICAN STATES ARE LETTING MILLIONS GO WITHOUT  INSURANCE. LOOK AT THIS IN TEXAS. THE DECISION TO REJECT MEDICAID  EXPANSION WILL LEAVE MORE THAN 1 MILLION UNINSURED. IN FLORIDA IT WILL LEAVE 764,000 UNINSURED. IN GEORGIA IT WILL MEAN THAT  OVER 400,000 PEOPLE WON&#39;T HAVE  COVERAGE. SO WHILE THEY&#39;RE TALKING ABOUT  GLITCHES, THEY ARE LITERALLY  BLOCKING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS  OF PEOPLE FROM EVEN HAVING THE  ABILITY TO COME INTO THE  PROGRAMS AND INSURE THEMSELVES. AND THEIR FAMILIES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, I&#39;M WITH REPRESENT REPRESENTATIVE PASCRELL ABOUT  THIS. PLACES LIKE IN GEORGIA G REFEEZ  TO EXPAND MEDICAID. THEY REFUSED TO MAKE THESE  EXCHANGES. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET ON  AND SIGN ON IN A MATTER OF  MINUTES. NOW THAT YOU HAVE PEOPLE IN THIS LARGE FEDERAL EXCHANGE THAT HAS  NOT WORKED AS WELL, THEY HAVE  FACED GLITCHES AND SOME TROUBLE  GETTING THROUGH THE WEB PORTAL  TO GET THE INSURANCE THEY RICHLY DESERVE. AT THE END OF THE DAY, THIS IS  ABOUT PIP POCK SI. LIKE YOU HAVE SENATORS LIKE TED  CRUZ, FOR INSTANCE, WHO HAS THE  MASERATI OF HEALTH CARE PLANS. PEOPLE LIKE RAND PAUL WHO HAS  EXCELLENT HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. AND YOU&#39;VE GOT MILLIONS OF  AMERICANS WHO WANT AT LEAST A  QUALITY, BASIC STANDARD OF CARE  AT A REASONABLE PRICE. AND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT  OFFERS THIS. WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO FIX THIS  WEB PORTAL AND GET AS MANY  PEOPLE ENROLLED AS POSSIBLE. BUT THAT IS WHAT REPUBLICANS  FEAR. THEY FEAR PEOPLE ARE GOING TO  GET ENROLLED AND GET THE CARE  THEY NEED AND THEY&#39;RE GOING TO  BE, WELL, OUT ON A LIMB COME  2014. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CONGRESSMAN, YOU KNOW WE&#39;RE  TALKING ABOUT HYPOCRISY. WE SAW HYPOCRISY AGAIN FROM THE  GOP TODAY. JUST LISTEN TO THESE REPUBLICANS ATTACK THE LAW TODAY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHAT&#39;S BECOME ABUNDANTLY  CLEAR, THE FLAW IS NOT THE  WEBSITE. THE FLAW IS THE LAW ITSELF. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE ON THIS SIDE OF THE AISLE  WANT THE HIGHEST QUALITY OF CARE FOR ALL AMERICANS. THE ACA VIOLATES EVERY ONE OF  THOSE PRINCIPLES.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE PROBLEMS DON&#39;T STOP AT  THE TECHNICAL FAILURES OF A  WEBSITE. IT STEMS FROM THE COLOSSAL  FAILURE TO DELIVER WHAT THIS LAW PROMISED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BUT THOSE EXACT SAME  REPUBLICANS, CONGRESSMAN, THOSE  EXACT SAME REPUBLICANS WERE  SINGING A DIFFERENT TUNE FOR THE MEDICARE PART &quot;D&quot; EXPANSION  UNDER PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH. WATCH. CONGRESSMAN BRADY SAID, QUOTE -- SAME GUY WE JUST SAW. HE SAYS IN A MAJOR REFORM, THERE ARE BOUND TO BE GLITCHES. CONGRESSMAN PRICE SAYS KINKS IN  PART &quot;D&quot; GOT WORKED OUT. AND CONGRESSMAN SAM JOHNSON TOLD ADMINISTRATORS, QUOTE, YOU GUYS  HAVE DONE A SUPER JOB. VERY DIFFERENT WHEN IT WAS PART  &quot;D&quot; OF MEDICAID UNDER GEORGE  BUSH AND NOW WHAT THEY&#39;RE SAYING UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION UNDER  THIS BILL THAT IS PROVIDING  HEALTH CARE FOR MILLIONS OF  PEOPLE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, REVEREND, YOU KNOW, I&#39;M A LAW AND ORDER MAN. AND WE HAVE A LAW THAT PEOPLE  DON&#39;T WANT TO OBEY. AND SO CONSEQUENTLY, WE&#39;RE GOING TO HAVE TO ORDER AS MANY YOUNG  PEOPLE WHO WANT INSURANCE TO  ENROLL. THE THING THEY WANT MORE THAN  ANYTHING ELSE IS FOR THE YOUNG  PEOPLE WHO WE ARE GOING TO  DEPEND ON ENROLLING IN THE  PROGRAM FOR IT TO WORK NOT  ENROLLING. AND WE&#39;VE GOT TO PUSH THAT. ALL OF THIS STUFF THAT THEY&#39;RE  DOING AND SAYING, SOME OF IT IS  SILLY. SUZANNE SOMERS, THREE&#39;S COMPANY, YET SHE WON&#39;T KEEP COMPANY WITH  FACTS. BUT I THINK THE THINGS THAT  WE&#39;RE SEEING RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE ABSURD AND THEY WOULD BE  LAUGHABLE IF IT WASN&#39;T FOR THE  FACT THAT MILLIONS AND MILLIONS  OF AMERICAN WHO IS NEED  INSURANCE ARE BEING SHADED AND  BLOCKED FROM GETTING THAT  INSURANCE BY RECALCITRANT  GOVERNORS. AND IT&#39;S A SIN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT REALLY IS. AND, YOU KNOW, GOLDIE, FOX NEWS  IS ON OVERDRIVE ON THIS. I MEAN, OVERDRIVE. THEY SEEM TO THINK THE PROBLEM  IS THAT AMERICANS HAVE TOO MUCH  INSURANCE, BELIEVE IT OR NOT. LISTEN TO THIS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE&#39;RE TALKING ABOUT THE  HEALTH CARE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE  OF THE U.S., NOT THE HEALTH  INSURANCE NEEDS. IT&#39;S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT THING. BEFORE THEY STARTED THIS, WE  WERE ALL IN TROUBLE WITH  INSURANCE TO BEGIN WITH. THERE&#39;S TOO MUCH HEALTH  INSURANCE. TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVE IT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I MEAN, TOO MUCH HEALTH  INSURANCE? THERE&#39;S TOO MUCH? TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVE IT? WHAT WORLD IS HE TALKING ABOUT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I&#39;M JUST STUNNED. I AM ABSOLUTELY STUNNED,  REVEREND SHARPTON. YOU KNOW, MAYBE HE DOESN&#39;T STAND GUARD AT YOUR LOCAL EMERGENCY  ROOM WHERE MY BETTER HALF WORKS. UNINSURED PEOPLE ROLL IN NIGHT  AFTER NIGHT WITH NO REAL MEANS  OF PAYING FOR THAT CARE, BUT  THEY&#39;RE CATASTROPHICALLY ILL AND THEY NEED TO SERVICE. GUESS WHO&#39;S PAYING FOR THAT? THE REST OF US ARE PAYING FOR  THAT CARE TODAY. WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT,  THIS SHIFTS THE BURDEN SO THAT  WE HAVE AN EXPANDED POOL OF RISK SO WE CAN SPREAD OUT SOME OF  THESE COSTS AND MAKE CERTAIN  THAT WE HAVE A MORE HEALTHY  SOCIETY AND AN ECONOMICALLY  VIABLE SOCIETY. ALL OF THIS BENEFITS ALL OF US. AND SO IT REALLY BOTHERS ME TO  HEAR SOMEONE SAY THAT WE HAD  OVER-INSURED PEOPLE IN THIS  COUNTRY WHERE THERE ARE CHILDREN THAT COULDN&#39;T GET  IMMUNIZIZATIONS TO GO TO SCHOOL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LIKE CONGRESSMAN CLEAVER  SAID, IT&#39;S A SIN.","media$content":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":800000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":621.421,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":360,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/y9watGOWW_t_?feed=PoliticsNation","plfile$width":640,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":500000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":621.421,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":240,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/_r0SQnN02kaZ?feed=PoliticsNation","plfile$width":420,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":621.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":0,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/4WkksDDez9Xx?feed=PoliticsNation","plfile$width":0,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"media$thumbnails":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"image","plfile$duration":0.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"JPEG","plfile$height":1080,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_sharp_1goldie2_131029.jpg","plfile$width":1920,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"link":"","pubDate":1383091620000,"plmedia$defaultThumbnailUrl":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_sharp_1goldie2_131029.jpg","nnd$associatedPlaylist":{"href":"http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_44263878"},"nnd$brand":"MSNBC","nnd$bureau":"30RockNY","nnd$bviAssetId":"n_sharp_1goldie_131029","nnd$canonicalUrl":{"href":"http://www.msnbc.com/politicsnation/watch/diagnosing-obamacare-myths-58355267874"},"nnd$distributionProfile":["MSN-CA","AWE"],"nnd$firstAiredAtUtc":1383170408000,"nnd$lastAiredAtUtc":1383170408000,"nnd$lastEditorialChangeAtUtc":1383316471000,"nnd$longTitle":"Diagnosing Obamacare myths","nnd$playCount30":6994,"nnd$playCountDay":55,"nnd$playCountYear":7015,"nnd$requiresCaptioning":true,"nnd$shortDescription":"Rev.

NOW IT&#39;S TIME TO JOIN THE FIGHT  AGAINST IT. IT&#39;S TIME FOR YOUR COLLEAGUES TO WAKE UP. JOINING ME NOW IS CONGRESSWOMAN  BARBARA LEE, DEMOCRAT FROM  CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR COMING ON THE  SHOW. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; VERY HAPPY TO BE WITH YOU,  REVEREND AL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; GOVERNOR KASICH CALLING OUT  REPUBLICANS FOR DEMONIZING THE  POOR. ARE SOME REPUBLICANS STARTING TO WAKE UP TO REALITY? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK THIS IS A VERY GOOD  SIGN, BECAUSE I ALWAYS SAY THAT  REPUBLICANS HAVE LOW INCOME  PEOPLE, PEOPLE WHO ARE POOR IN  THEIR DISTRICTS ALSO. WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS TAKING  PLACE AND THANK YOU FOR  MENTIONING WHAT&#39;S TAKING PLACE  ON FRIDAY, REVEREND AL. WE HAVE NOW A $5 BILLION  AUTOMATIC CUT IN THE S.N.A.P.  PROGRAM WHICH IS GOING TO TAKE  AWAY APPROXIMATELY 20 MEALS, I  THINK THAT&#39;S THE ESTIMATE, FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR A MONTH. AND SO WE&#39;RE TRYING TO WAKE UP  THE COUNTRY AND WAKE UP THE  REPUBLICANS SO THAT WE CAN GET  LEGISLATION PASSED VERY QUICKLY  SO THAT WE CAN AT LEAST EXTEND  THESE AUTOMATIC CUTS THAT WILL  TAKE PLACE ON FRIDAY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND I MIGHT ADD THAT AS YOU  TALK ABOUT WAKING UP THE PUBLIC, LET&#39;S NOT FORGET THAT GOVERNOR  KASICH AND OTHERS ARE UP FOR  RE-ELECTION NEXT YEAR. SO AN AWAKENED PUBLIC MAY BE  SOMETHING TO CONSIDER WHEN YOU  HEAR WHAT KASICH IS SAYING. LET ME ASK YOU THIS. KASICH TALKED ABOUT CALLING THE  POOR LAZY. JUST WATCH WHERE REPUBLICANS GET THIS IDEA. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LOOK AT POVERTY IN THIS  COUNTRY. EVERYBODY OUT OF WORK IS EATING. THEY&#39;VE GOT BIG SCREEN TV,  PROBABLY HAVE A CAR, PROBABLY  HAVE A CELL PHONE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IS AMERICA BECOMING A WELFARE STATE? THE ANSWER IS YES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I GOT NEWS FOR YOU. IN OTHER COUNTRIES, THEY&#39;RE NOT  WASHING THEIR CLOTHES AND  SITTING IN AIR CONDITIONING  WATCHING A BIG SCREEN TV. THEY&#39;RE DYING. THAT IS A POOR. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE THING WE&#39;VE GOT TO DEAL  WITH MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN  THE COUNTRY IS DEAL WITH THE  MIND-SET OF ENTITLEMENT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; -- ENCOURAGING PARASITES TO  COME OUT AND TAKE AS MUCH AS  THEY CAN WITH NO REMORSE AND  THIS IS HOW OUR COUNTRY  DECLINES. THIS IS HOW WE BECOME A WEAK  NATION. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I MEAN, THIS UGLY VENOMOUS  PORTRAYAL OF POOR PEOPLE, THE  MOST VULNERABLE IN SOCIETY, THEY SET UP THIS CLIMATE. IT&#39;S DESPICABLE BECAUSE TO SAY  YOU&#39;VE GOT TO BE DYING TO BE  POOR, THAT YOU HAVE A SENSE OF  ENTITLEMENT WHEN YOU CAN BARELY  GET BY ON WHAT FOOD STAMPS PAY. IT IS OUTRAGEOUS AND IT IS  TELLING BOLDFACE LIES. THAT IS NOT WHAT MOST POOR  PEOPLE ARE DEALING WITH. AND THIS WHOLE PICTURE OF LAID  BACK WATCHING BIG SCREEN TVs,  THIS KIND OF PROFILING AND  STEREOTYPING IS UTTERLY  DESPICABLE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YES, REVEREND AL. IT&#39;S DISGUSTING. IT&#39;S A SHAME, A DISGRACE. IT&#39;S UN-AMERICAN. THOSE ARE THE VALUES THAT THE  MAJORITY OF AMERICANS HOLD. LET ME JUST SAY, THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ON S.N.A.P.  BENEFITS, FOOD STAMPS, ARE  WORKING. THEY&#39;RE PART OF THE WORKING  POOR. THEY&#39;RE LOW WAGE WORKERS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT INCOME  INEQUALITY IN WHAT IS TAKING  PLACE, YOU&#39;RE LOOKING AT PEOPLE  MAKING $7 AND $8 A AN HOUR. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? WE NEED TO HAVE A LIVING WAGE  FOR PEOPLE. WE NEED TO PROVIDE A PATHWAY TO  A JOB, WORKFORCE TRAINING. I WAS ON FOOD STAMPS, REVEREND  AL. NOBODY WANTS TO BE ON FOOD  STAMPS. EVERYONE WANTS A JOB. EVERYONE WANTS TO LIVE THE  AMERICAN DREAM. OFTENTIMES PEOPLE NEED THAT  BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATER. WE&#39;RE BARELY OUT OF A TERRIBLE,  TERRIBLE RECESSION. AND SO FOR THE RIGHT WING, THE  EXTREME RADICALS TO REALLY BEGIN TO DEMONIZE PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST  TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR  FAMILIES AND MOVE FORWARD TO  LIVE THE AMERICAN DREAM AGAIN,  IT&#39;S UN-AMERICAN, IT&#39;S IMMORAL,  DISGRACE. WE SHOULD BE OUTRAGED AT SOME OF THESE COMMENTS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. QUICKLY, THE CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS ISSUED ITS ANNUAL  REPORT FOR POVERTY IN AMERICA. YOU WERE THERE TO TALK ABOUT IT. THE REPORT FOUND THERE ARE OVER  46 MILLION AMERICANS LIVING  BELOW THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE. THAT&#39;S ONE IN SIX AMERICANS,  CONGRESSWOMAN LEE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IN THE WEALTHIEST AND MOST  POWERFUL COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. 42% OF SINGLE WOMEN HEAD OF  HOUSEHOLDS LIVE BELOW THE  POVERTY LINE. AND LET ME TELL YOU, WE HAVE A  PLAN TO CUT POVERTY IN HALF IN  TEN YEARS. WE KNOW HOW TO DO IT. I HAVE LEGISLATION THAT WOULD  REQUIRE US TO BEGIN TO MOVE DOWN THAT PATH. AND SO I HOPE THAT PEOPLE  WATCHING YOUR SHOW TONIGHT  EMBRACE OUR LEGISLATION TO CUT  POVERTY IN HALF. IT CAN BE DONE. WE HAVE NOW CHILDREN UNDER 5,  FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE  AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, 42%  OF CHILDREN ARE LIVING UNDER THE POVERTY LINE. 37% OF LATINO CHILDREN LIVING  BELOW THE POVERTY LINE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CHILDREN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE HAVE UNBELIEVABLE NUMBERS  OF CHILDREN WHO ARE POOR. WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT WHO WE  ARE AS A COUNTRY? WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD. WE NEED TO HAVE A STRATEGY AND  PLAN. I&#39;M VERY PROUD AS A DEMOCRAT AND THE CHAIR OF OUR TASK FORCE ON  POVERTY AND OPPORTUNITY THAT WE  KNOW HOW TO GET THERE. IF ONLY WE HAD A BIPARTISAN  STRATEGY WITH THE REPUBLICANS TO DO THIS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CONGRESSWOMAN BARBARA LEE,","media$content":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":451.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":0,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/4fBp8y_4K769?feed=PoliticsNation","plfile$width":0,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":500000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":451.418,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":240,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/6Y23NPQOZD6X?feed=PoliticsNation","plfile$width":420,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":800000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":451.418,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":360,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/fuuq8QzKRXrM?feed=PoliticsNation","plfile$width":640,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"media$thumbnails":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"image","plfile$duration":0.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"JPEG","plfile$height":1080,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_sharp_2lee_131029.jpg","plfile$width":1920,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"link":"","pubDate":1383091440000,"plmedia$defaultThumbnailUrl":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_sharp_2lee_131029.jpg","nnd$associatedPlaylist":{"href":"http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_44263878"},"nnd$brand":"MSNBC","nnd$bureau":"30RockNY","nnd$bviAssetId":"n_sharp_2lee_131029","nnd$canonicalUrl":{"href":"http://www.msnbc.com/politicsnation/watch/new-food-stamp-cuts-looming-58331715745"},"nnd$distributionProfile":["MSN-CA","AWE"],"nnd$firstAiredAtUtc":1383171341000,"nnd$lastAiredAtUtc":1383171341000,"nnd$lastEditorialChangeAtUtc":1383316466000,"nnd$longTitle":"New food stamp cuts looming","nnd$playCount30":4714,"nnd$playCountDay":46,"nnd$playCountYear":4728,"nnd$requiresCaptioning":true,"nnd$shortDescription":"Rep.

NOTHING MORE, NOTHING LESS. THE PERSON THAT SHOT AND KILLED  MY SON IS WALKING THE STREETS  TODAY. AND THIS LAW DOES NOT WORK. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SABRIYBRINA FULTON TESTIFYING IN  WASHINGTON TODAY ABOUT STAND  YOUR GROUND LAWS AND THE ROLE OF THEM IN THE DEATH OF HER SON  TRAYVON MARTIN. IT WAS A SERIOUS HEARING. BUT SENATOR CRUZ SEEMED TO THINK IT WAS A CHANCE TO JUST SCORE  SOME CHEAP POLITICAL POINTS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE KNOW THAT SOME IN OUR  POLITICAL PROCESS HAVE A DESIRE  TO EXPLOIT THAT TRAGIC, VIOLENT  INCIDENT. WE HAVE SEEN EFFORTS TO  UNDERMINE THE VERDICT OF THE  JURY AND MORE BROADLY TO INFLAME RACIAL TENSIONS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE ONLY THING INFLAMING  RACIAL TENSIONS WAS THE NOT JUST LAW. CRUZ WENT ON TO SAY THE STAND  YOUR GROUND LAW ACTUALLY HELPS  AFRICAN-AMERICANS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IN FLORIDA THE DATA SHOWS  THAT AFRICAN-AMERICAN DEFENDANTS HAVE AVAILED THEMSELVES OF THE  STAND YOUR GROUND DEFENSE MORE  FREQUENTLY THAN HAVE ANGLO  DEFENDANTS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; STAND YOUR GROUND IS GOOD LAW FOR MINORITIES? HE&#39;S WRONG. THE NUMBERS TELL THE STORY. UNDER STAND YOUR GROUND, IF THE  VICTIM IS BLACK OR HISPANIC, THE KILLER WALKS FREE 78% OF THE  TIME. BUT IF THE VICTIM IS WHITE, THE  KILLER WALKS FREE 56% OF THE  TIME. A 22 POINT DIFFERENCE. NO MATTER WHAT SELF-APPOINTED  EXPERT TED CRUZ SAYS, THOSE ARE  THE FACTS THAT REALLY MATTER. JOINING ME NOW IS TRAYVON  MARTIN&#39;S MOTHER SYBRINA FULTON  AND HER LAWYER DARYL PARKS. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR HAVING US. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, I KNOW IT&#39;S BEEN AN EMOTIONAL DAY FOR YOU, SYBRINA,  BUT WHAT&#39;S YOUR RESPONSE TO  THESE COMMENTS OF STAND YOUR  GROUND THAT SENATOR TED CRUZ  MADE DURING THE HEARING TODAY? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK THERE&#39;S SOME  DISCONNECT THERE. I THINK HE CERTAINLY IS NOT  AWARE OF THE REAL LAW AND HOW IT AFFECTS US AS A COMMUNITY. I HAVE A REAL PROBLEM WHEN  TEENAGERS ARE AFRAID TO WALK TO  THE STORE FOR A DRINK AND CANDY. THERE ARE ISSUES THERE. AND YOU WANT EVERYBODY TO FEEL  COMFORTABLE AND YOU WANT  EVERYBODY TO FEEL SAFE IN THEIR  NEIGHBORHOOD. AND JUST MERELY WALKING DOWN THE STREET AND, YOU KNOW, YOU&#39;RE NOT ARMED. TRAYVON WAS NOT ARMED. IT JUST SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING  NEEDS TO BE FIXED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHAT MISPERCEPTIONS DID YOU  HEAR ABOUT THE LAW TODAY? YOU TALK ABOUT THE DISCONNECT. WHAT DID YOU HEAR TODAY THAT  MADE YOU BELIEVE PEOPLE IN THE  SENATE JUST REALLY DON&#39;T  UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF THIS  LAW? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT  WAS SAID THAT WAS STAND YOUR  GROUND WAS NOT USED IN THIS  CASE. I HEARD STAND YOUR GROUND FOR  OVER A YEAR. IT WASN&#39;T UNTIL THE DEFENSE HAD  HAD TO FILE A MOTION THAT I  STOPPED HEARING STAND YOUR  GROUND, WHICH WAS A YEAR LATER. WHICH WAS APRIL OF 2013. FROM FEBRUARY 26, 2012, I HAD  BEEN HEARING ABOUT STAND YOUR  GROUND FROM THE POLICE  DEPARTMENT, FROM THE ATTORNEYS,  FROM THE NEWS. EVERYBODY SAID STAND YOUR  GROUND. AND IT WASN&#39;T SOMETHING THAT WE  MADE UP. IT WAS SOMETHING THAT THEY WERE  GOING TO USE. SO IT CERTAINLY PLAYED A PART. IN ADDITION TO THAT, ALSO THE  JURY WAS GIVEN INSTRUCTIONS THAT HAD INFORMATION ON THERE ABOUT  STAND YOUR GROUND. SO IT&#39;S NOT THAT WE&#39;RE MAKING -- YOU KNOW, MAKING ANYTHING UP. IT&#39;S JUST THAT IT WAS BEING  USED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; STAND YOUR GROUND, ATTORNEY  PARKS, WAS WHY THEY DIDN&#39;T --  THEY LET ZIMMERMAN GO AT THE  PRECINCT AND NOT CHARGE HIM. PART OF IT WAS STAND YOUR  GROUND. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; FOR CERTAIN. AND REV, I THINK YOU HAVE TO  FOCUS ON THE FACT THAT THE  POLICE DEPARTMENT, THEY  HESITATED IN ARRESTING GEORGE  ZIMMERMAN BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT  IT EXISTED. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WE SEE HERE  IS THE FACT A TRUE EQUAL  PRODUCTION PROBLEM AND DUE  PROCESS PROBLEM UNDER THE 5th  AND 14th AMENDMENT THAT MAKES AN AMBIGUOUS LAW IS THE REASON THE  LAW HAS TO BE CHANGED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOW, SYBRINA, YOU HAVE BEEN  FIGHTING DILIGENTLY. YOU AND YOUR WHOLE FAMILY HAVE  BEEN ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND IN YOUR HOME STATE OF FLORIDA  FIGHTING THIS. AND I WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT  THERE HAS BEEN PROGRESS. ALL OF THE FIGHTING HAS NOT GONE IN VAIN. IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA, THEY&#39;VE ALREADY APPROVED CHANGES IN THE  EXISTING LAW. NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH PEOPLE ARE  NOT ALLOWED TO PURSUE OR  CONFRONT SUSPECTS. AGGRESSORS CAN&#39;T CLAIM STAND  YOUR GROUND IN THEIR DEFENSE. AND NOW WE&#39;RE LEARNING THE STATE IS ALSO GOING TO HOLD A HEARING  TO REPEAL STAND YOUR GROUND NEXT WEEK. SO THERE&#39;S BEEN SOME PROGRESS. ARE YOU HOPEFUL ABOUT THE  DIRECTION THAT LAWMAKERS ARE  TAKING THERE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YES. I THINK ANY STEP THEY&#39;RE TAKING, EVEN TODAY JUST COMING TO  WASHINGTON, D.C. JUST FOR THEM  TO LISTEN TO WHAT I HAVE TO SAY  WAS IMPORTANT. BECAUSE I THINK IT&#39;S A STEP  TOWARDS THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND I KNOW IT&#39;S NOT GOING TO BE  DONE OVERNIGHT. I KNOW IT&#39;S GOING TO TAKE TIME  IN ORDER FOR US TO GET THESE  CHANGES MADE. BUT IT&#39;S WORTH IT. IF WE LOSE ONE LIFE  UNNECESSARILY, I THINK IT&#39;S  WORTH US JUST FIGHTING AND JUST  WORKING HARD JUST TO TRY AND  MAKE SOME DIFFERENCE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SYBRINA FULTON AND DARYL  PARKS, THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR  TIME TONIGHT AND THANK YOU FOR  THE WORK YOU&#39;RE DOING IN HONOR  OF YOUR SON&#39;S MEMORY TRAYVON  MARTIN. WE&#39;LL STAY ON THIS STORY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt;&gt; AHEAD, ACCUSATIONS OF RACIAL PROFILING AT BARNEY&#39;S DEPARTMENT STORE.

TEXAS REPUBLICANS LED BY  GOVERNOR RICK PERRY PUSHED  THROUGH ONE OF THE MOST  RESTRICTIVE ABORTION LAWS IN THE COUNTRY. IT CAME AFTER A MARATHON  FILIBUSTER BY STATE SENATOR  WENDY DAVIS IN WHICH THOUSANDS  OF PRO-CHOICE PROTESTERS MADE IT KNOWN THEY DID NOT WANT THEIR  RIGHTS RESTRICTED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE VOTE IS BEING TAKEN RIGHT NOW. THIS IS WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE  INSIDE THE ROTUNDA. THESE SCREAMS ARE DEAFENING. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; UNFORTUNATELY FOR THEM,  GOVERNOR PERRY AND THE RIGHT  WING CONTROL TEXAS STATE HOUSE  IGNORED THEIR PLEAS. BUT TODAY A VICTORY. THE BREAKING NEWS CAME LATE  TODAY. A FEDERAL JUDGE BLOCKED A KEY  PORTION OF THE LAW CALLING IT,  QUOTE, UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THE DECISION SAVED THE STATE  FROM CLOSING A THIRD OF ITS  ABORTION CLINICS. AND WHILE THE -- AND WHILE TODAY THERE WAS A VICTORY, THE FIGHT  IS FAR FROM OVER. TEXAS ATTORNEY GENERAL GREG  ABBOTT SAYS HE&#39;LL TAKE THIS  FIGHT ALL THE WAY TO THE SUPREME COURT. AND WE&#39;LL ALL BE WATCHING. JOINING ME NOW ARE KRYSTAL BALL  AND PATRICIA MURPHY. THANK YOU BOTH FOR COMING ON THE SHOW TONIGHT. KRYSTAL, THIS FIGHT BECAME  NATIONAL NEWS BECAUSE OF STATE  SENATOR WENDY DAVIS&#39; FILIBUSTER  FIGHT. HOW BIG OF A MESSAGE DID TODAY&#39;S RULING SEND NATIONALLY? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I THINK IT&#39;S VERY IMPORTANT  BOTH IN TERMS OF THE MESSAGE  THAT IT SENDS. YOU KNOW, THE RULING THAT THESE  SORTS OF RESTRICTIONS ARE  CLEARLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL. SO IT&#39;S IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF  THE MESSAGE. IT&#39;S ALSO IN TERMS OF THE  SUBSTANCE. BECAUSE TEXAS IS NOT THE ONLY  STATE TRYING TO TAKE AWAY THE  WOMAN&#39;S RIGHT TO CHOOSE. THERE ARE A LOT OF STATES THAT  HAVE PASSED OR ARE LOOKING TO  PASS SIMILAR PROVISIONS. THEY&#39;RE USUALLY CALL EED TRAP  BILLS WHICH IMPOSE REQUIREMENTS  ON ABORTION PROVIDERS FORCING  THEM TO CLOSE. WHICH IS WHY A THIRD OF THESE  ABORTION CLINICS IN TEXAS LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE TO  CLOSE. FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE, THE LEGAL PRECEDENT ALSO COULD BE VERY  IMPORTANT HERE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOW, PATRICIA, GOVERNOR PERRY ISSUED THIS STATEMENT ABOUT THE  ABORTION RULING SAYING, QUOTE,  TODAY&#39;S DECISION WILL NOT STOP  OUR ONGOING EFFORTS. WE WILL CONTINUE FIGHTING TO  IMPLEMENT THE LAWS PASSED BY THE DUALLY ELECTED OFFICIALS OF OUR  STATE. LAWS THAT REFLECT THE WILL AND  VALUES OF THE TEXANS. ABBOTT SAYS HE&#39;S GOING TO FIGHT  UP TO THE SUPREME COURT, TEXAS  ATTORNEY GENERAL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; RICK PERRY IS NOT ALONE AMONG REPUBLICANS WHO BELIEVE THIS IS  A WINNING POLITICAL ISSUE FOR  THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THERE&#39;S ACTUALLY A LOT OF  POLLING THAT SHOWS THAT WOMEN  ARE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE  IDEA OF ABORTION AFTER 20 WEEKS. BUT THERE&#39;S MORE POLLING THAT  SHOWS THEY&#39;RE LESS COMFORTABLE  WITH A PANEL OF ALL MEN DECIDING THAT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SPECIFIC  PIECE OF A BILL THAT WAS STRUCK  DOWN AS KRYSTAL WAS SAYING  TODAY, THIS REALLY HAD NOTHING  TO DO ABOUT THE HEALTH OF WOMEN  OR ANYTHING REALLY ANYTHING TO  DO WITH THAT AS REPUBLICANS WERE SAYING. IT REALLY HAD EVERYTHING TO DO  WITH MAKING IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE WHAT IS STILL A LEGAL  PROCEDURE IN TEXAS AND THE  UNITED STATES. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SPECIFICS,  IT&#39;S CLEAR THIS REALLY IS ALL  ABOUT POLITICS FOR RICK PERRY,  ABSOLUTELY, AND A NUMBER OF  REPUBLICANS WILL ABSOLUTELY SEE  THIS SAME ISSUE COME UP IN THE  SENATE. I THINK WE&#39;LL SEE PUSHBACK FROM  WOMEN AGAIN WHO SAY THIS IS A  DECISION THEY SHOULD BE MAKING,  THEIR DOCTORS SHOULD BE MAKING  AND NO PANEL OF MALE LEGISLATORS NEED TO BE MAKING THE DECISION  FOR THEM. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SHE&#39;S RIGHT. THIS WAS AROUND ADMITTANCE AND  THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF  HAVING CERTAIN -- HAVING YOUR  HEALTH CARE EVEN TAKEN CARE OF  STARTING WITH ADMITTANCE INTO  HOSPITALS THAT WOULD TAKE THEM. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND WHAT&#39;S GOING ON HERE  ACROSS THE COUNTRY IS THERE&#39;S  ESSENTIALLY A LEGISLATIVE  PLAYBOOK BEING ROLLED OUT IN  STATE AFTER STATE. WHERE THEY&#39;RE GOING EVERYTHING  THEY CAN TO PRETEND LIKE THEY  HAVE WOMEN&#39;S HEALTH IN MIND. BUT REALLY THE GOAL IS IS TO  JUST SHUT DOWN ABORTION CLINICS  AND MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE. SO YOU HAVE CERTAIN STATES IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. YOU ONLY HAVE ONE CLINIC STILL  OPERATING. ALREADY IN TEXAS BEFORE THESE  PROVISIONS -- BY THE WAY, THESE  PROVISIONS WERE SET TO GO INTO  EFFECT WITHIN 24 HOURS. SO EVEN BEFORE THAT, YOU HAVE  WOMEN WHO IT&#39;S SO DIFFICULT FOR  THEM TO OBTAIN THE LEGAL  PROCEDURE OF ABORTION IN TEXAS  THAT THEY WERE HAVING TO GO  ACROSS THE BORDER TO MEXICO. WHICH IS A VERY SCARY SITUATION. YEAH. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOW, PATRICIA, TODAY&#39;S RULING WAS A BIG VICTORY FOR WENDY  DAVIS. NOW THAT SHE&#39;S RUNNING FOR  GOVERNOR, HER FOCUS ON WOMEN&#39;S  ISSUES COULD EFFECT THE WHOLE  PARTY. A DAVIS CANDIDACY MIGHT NOT BE  SUCCESSFUL IN THE TEXAS  GOVERNOR&#39;S RACE, BUT THE HIGH  PROFILE OF THE CAMPAIGN WILL  KEEP ATTENTION ON THE ISSUES  WHICH HELPED DEMOCRATS. THE GOP MAY WISELY CONVINCE ITS  MOST GAFFE-HAPPY MEMBERS TO SHUT UP WHEN IT COMES TO MATTERS LIKE RAPE AND CONTRACEPTION, BUT  DAVIS WILL BE TALKING. INTERESTING. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YEAH. I&#39;M SORRY, GO AHEAD. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NO, GO AHEAD. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY I  REALLY DO AGREE WITH THAT  ASSESSMENT. THIS IS THE ISSUE THAT LAUNCHED  WENDY DAVIS TO NATIONAL ACCLAIM. SO THIS WILL MAKE WENDY DAVIS&#39;  SINGLE ISSUE THE BIGGEST ISSUE  GOING ON REALLY ACROSS THE  COUNTRY. NOW, THIS IS GOING TO BE HER  ISSUE. THIS GIVES HER CAMPAIGN A BIG  BOOST. WHY IS SHE RUNNING? THIS IS WHY. SHE&#39;S TELL YOU THAT. I THINK FOR OTHER SENATE RACES  ACROSS THE COUNTRY, LOOK AT A  RACE LIKE THE SENATE RACE IN  GEORGIA. LOOK AT THE SENATE RACE IN  KENTUCKY. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PLACES  WHERE THERE ARE VERY  CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS RUNNING AGAINST MORE MODERATE  REPUBLICANS AND ALL DEMOCRATS  WANT IS FOR THE ENTIRE SENATE  CAMPAIGN TO BE ABOUT ABORTION,  CONTRACEPTION, WHAT IS REAL  RAPE. THOSE ARE THE CONVERSATIONS THAT REPUBLICANS HAD IN 2012 THAT  ABSOLUTELY SANK THEIR  CANDIDACIES. DEMOCRATS, IF THEY COULD HAVE  THAT PLAYBOOK REDRAWN AND JUST  RUN THE WHOLE PLAY AGAIN, THEY  WOULD LOVE TO. WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS DECISION COMING OUT OF TEXAS, WE KNOW IT&#39;S GOING TO THE SUPREME  COURT. THAT KEEPS THESE SOCIAL ISSUES  IN THE LIGHT. IF THEY LET THE REPUBLICANS BEAT EACH OTHER UP, MAKE A HUGE GAFFE AND THEN LET A MODERATE DEMOCRAT COME IN AND SAVE THE DAY, THAT  IS WHAT THEY&#39;RE HOPING FOR. THIS DECISION GIVES THEM A LOT  OF HOPE THEY HAVE TERRAIN THAT  COULD BE VERY FRIENDLY TO THEM  IN 2014. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BUT, YOU KNOW, KRYSTAL,  GOVERNOR PERRY SAID WE&#39;RE GOING  TO MAKE ABORTION A THING OF THE  PAST. YOU&#39;RE DEALING WITH A 20-WEEK  BAN IN TEXAS AND IN OTHER  STATES. IS THIS WHAT A LOT OF &#39;14 IS  GOING TO BE ABOUT? THESE STATES WITH 20-WEEK BANS? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE&#39;VE ALREADY SEEN THIS  HAPPENING ACROSS THE COUNTRY. DESPITE THE FACT WE SAW A LOT OF ATTENTION AROUND THE WAR ON  WOMEN IN 2012 AND 2011 WITH THE  COMMENTS ABOUT SANDRA FLUKE AND  VAGINAL PROBES IN VIRGINIA. REPUBLICAN STATE LEGISLATURES  DID NOT GET THE MESSAGE. SO IN OHIO WITH WHO IS  SUPPOSEDLY A MODERATE  REPUBLICAN, JOHN KASICH, HE&#39;S  ALSO BEEN PASSING THESE VERY  CONTROVERSIAL ABORTION BILLS. SO THEY HAVEN&#39;T -- YOU KNOW,  THEY HAVEN&#39;T GOTTEN THE MESSAGE  HERE. THEY&#39;RE STILL LAUNCHING THESE  EXTREME TACTICS. ONE NOTE ON WENDY DAVIS IN  TEXAS. EVEN IF SHE&#39;S NOT ABLE TO  SUCCEED THIS TIME AROUND RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR, WHICH IT IS WAY  TOO FAR OUT TO KNOW, BUT IN  TERMS OF TURNING TEXAS BLUE,  HAVING A CANDIDATE LIKE HER WHO  IS GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF  ENERGY, WHO IS GOING TO START TO BUILD AN INFRASTRUCTURE IS  IMPORTANT TO THE FUTURE  DEMOCRATIC POLITICS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LET ME BRING TO VIRGINIA. CUCCINELLI IS LOSING THE  VIRGINIA GOVERNOR&#39;S RACE BIG  TIME. BUT WOMEN ARE HURTING HIM THE  MOST. HE&#39;S DOWN BY EIGHT POINTS AMONG  VOTERS, BUT DOWN BY 25 POINTS  WITH WOMEN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT IS BRUTAL. AND HE ACTUALLY IN THE LAST  POLLING I SAW IS WINNING AMONG  MEN. SO IT IS TRULY THE WOMEN WHO ARE AGAINST HIS EXTREME TACTICS. AND I THINK IT&#39;S WAY MORE THAN  JUST ABORTION. THAT IS CERTAINLY PART OF IT,  BUT THIS IS A GUY WHO JUST  DOESN&#39;T KNOW HOW TO WORK WITH  ANYONE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE  AISLE WHO IS WAY TOO EXTREME FOR MOST VIRGINIANS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; PATRICIA, IT&#39;S NO WONDER THE  PARTY IS VERY ANTI-WOMAN. WHEN YOU LISTEN TO THE RIGHT  WINGERS THEY LISTEN TO. LISTEN TO THIS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE CHICKIFICATION OF  EVERYTHING IS TAKING PLACE. WHICH WHAT IS THAT? RUSH, WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT MEANS THAT FEELINGS ARE  TRIUMPHING OVER COMMENON SENSE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I WANT TO TURN TO RESEARCH  SHOWING THAT WOMEN HAVE BECOME  THE BREADWINNERS IN THIS COUNTRY AND A LOT OF OTHER CONCERNING  AND TROUBLING STATISTICS. WHEN WE&#39;RE WATCHING SOCIETY  DISSOLVE AROUND US. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SOMETHING GOING TERRIBLY  WRONG IN AMERICAN SOCIETY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU LOOK AT BIOLOGY, LOOK AT  THE NATURAL WORLD. THE ROLES OF A MALE AND FEMALE  IN OTHER SOCIETIES, THE MALE IS  TYPICALLY THE DOMINANT ROLE. THE FEMALE IS NOT ANTITHESIS OR  IT&#39;S NOT COMPETING. IT&#39;S A COMPLIMENTARY ROLE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHAT THEY HAVE DONE, THE  DEMOCRATS, THEY HAVE INVENTED  THIS PHONY WAR ON WOMEN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I MEAN, YOU WOULD ALMOST  THINK IT WAS A MONTAGE OF &quot;SNL&quot;  SKITS. IF IT WASN&#39;T SO SAD, PATRICIA. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT REALLY FEELS MORE LIKE A  MONTAGE OF &quot;THE FLINTSTONES.&quot; THAT IS CAVEMAN CONVERSATION  GOING ON THERE. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I&#39;M TALKING ABOUT. YOU CANNOT HAVE A PARTY THAT IS  BEING DRAGGED TO THE RIGHT BY  TALK RADIO AND HAVE A PARTY THAT IS ALSO GOING TO WIN NATIONAL  ELECTIONS. IT&#39;S JUST NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. I CAN&#39;T EVEN REALLY PROCESS MOST OF WHAT I&#39;VE JUST HEARD. EXCEPT --  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CHICK-IFICATION. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; REPUBLICANS HAVE A NUMBER OF  HAVING TALENTED -- ACTUALLY FOUR REPUBLICAN WOMEN GOVERNORS IN  THIS COUNTRY. YOU NEVER SEE THEM ON NATIONAL  TV. YOU NEVER SEE THEM BEING  HIGHLIGHTED BY THE REPUBLICAN  PARTY. THIS IS A PARTY AT WAR WITH  ITSELF. IF IT WAS SMART, IT WOULD PUT  FORWARD SOME OF ITS OWN WOMEN  LEADERS TO DO THE TALKING. BUT THEY LET THE CHIPS FALL  WHERE THEY MAY.

TONIGHT&#39;S LEAD, THE GOP&#39;S TED  CRUZ PROBLEM. HIS CAMERA-LOVING CRUSADE  AGAINST OBAMA CARE DROVE THE  PARTY TO RECORD LOWS. AND IT SEEMS THE TEXAN IS JUST  GETTING WARMED UP. HE SPENT THE WEEKEND PRETENDING  TO BE A POPULIST IN IOWA. AND WHAT&#39;S BETTER THAN HAVING  THE RIGHT WING PR GAME OF A  LITTLE PHEASANT HUNTING TRIP  WITH THE FAR RIGHT TEA PARTY  CONGRESSMAN STEVE KING. GREAT FOR THE IMAGE. BEFORE HUNTING, CRUZ RECEIVED  MULTIPLE STANDING OVATIONS FROM  THE RABID RIGHT WHERE HE  CONTINUED HIS MYTH-TELLING  CAMPAIGN AND THE CROWD LOVED IT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE ARE FACING EXTRAORDINARY  TLETSS TO OUR NATION. WE ARE SEEING AN ADMINISTRATION  THAT SEEMS BENT ON VIOLATING  EVERY CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTION  WE HAVE IN THE BILL OF RIGHTS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AN EXTRAORDINARY THREAT? MORE OF THEIR TRADEMARK FEAR  MONGERING ON DISPLAY. AND DESPITE POLL NUMBERS SINKING LIKE A STONE, THE GOP HASN&#39;T  LEARNED ANYTHING OVER THE PAST  YEAR. TAKE A LOOK. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S THE NUMBER ONE JOB  KILLER IN THIS COUNTRY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THERE&#39;S THIS BIG CLOUD  HANGING OVER SMALL BUSINESS  RIGHT NOW. IT&#39;S OBAMA CARE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND IT&#39;S DENYING CARE TO  MILLIONS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; UNDER OBAMA CARE THEY&#39;RE  CUTTING $716 BILLION FROM  MEDICARE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE WAY WE&#39;RE GOING TO STOP  OBAMA CARE, IT&#39;S GOING TO COME  FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHEN WE ELECT ME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, WE&#39;RE GOING  TO GET RID OF OBAMA CARE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; MEMORIES. WE&#39;RE GOING TO GET RID OF OBAMA  CARE. HOW&#39;D THAT WORK OUT? JUST LIKE IT WAS GOING TO BE HIS WATERLOO. NEED MORE PROOF THE ANTI-OBAMA  CRUSADE IS HURTING THE PARTY? LOOK AT THE GREAT STATE OF  VIRGINIA. A TEST CASE FOR FAR RIGHT  CONSERVATIVES. KEN CUCCINELLI, THE REPUBLICAN  CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR, AND  SINCE THE SHUTDOWN HE&#39;S SINKING  DOWN 11 POINTS IN THE POLLS THIS SUMMER. BUT TODAY HIS BIG RESPONSE WAS  TO CALL IN TEA PARTY SENATOR  RAND PAUL WHO VOTED FOR THE  SHUTDOWN. SEE THE PATTERN? THEIR ANSWER TO REJECTION IS TO  GO EVEN FARTHER TO THE RIGHT. HOW&#39;S THAT FOR A WINNING  STRATEGY? LET&#39;S PUT THE FIRE OUT WITH MORE GAS. GOOD LUCK, REPUBLICANS. JOINING ME NOW IS CONGRESSMAN  JOHN YARMOUTH, DEMOCRAT FROM  KENTUCKY, AND JOAN WALSH FROM  SALON.COM. THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING ON THE  SHOW. CONGRESSMAN, AFTER ROMNEY LOST  THE ELECTION, THE GOP SWORE IT  WAS REBRANDING. BUT NOW WE HAVE TED CRUZ IN IOWA CONTINUING WITH THIS MYTH  CAMPAIGN. WHAT&#39;S GOING ON HERE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, REVEREND, IT&#39;S AMAZING. JOHN BOEHNER NOVEMBER 7th AFTER  THE ELECTION LAST YEAR SAID  WE&#39;RE FINISHED WITH TRYING TO  REPEAL OBAMA CARE. THAT BATTLE&#39;S BEEN WON. THAT WAR&#39;S BEEN WON. NOW THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS  ACTING LIKE MANY OF THE JAPANESE SOLDIERS WHO KEPT FIGHTING  MONTHS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS  AFTER THE JAPANESE HAD  SURRENDERED. THE WAR IS OVER, BUT THEY ARE  CONTINUING TO BASICALLY JUST TO  TRY AND REAP WHATEVER POLITICAL  BENEFIT THEY CAN FROM THEIR BASE TO TRY -- FROM THIS FEAR OF  OBAMA CARE, THE FEAR OF  PRESIDENT OBAMA. IT&#39;S IRRATIONAL. IT&#39;S NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THEIR CONSTITUENTS, BUT THEY  KEEP AT IT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; AND YOU KNOW, JOAN, I  MENTIONED IN THE OPENING IT&#39;S  PLAYING OUT IN THE STATE  ELECTIONS THIS YEAR. FOR EXAMPLE, IN VIRGINIA TED  CRUZ AND HIS OBAMA CARE CRUSADE  HAS BECOME A LIGHTNING ROD IN  THAT RACE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; RIGHT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; IT&#39;S PLAYING OUT THERE AND  WHEN YOU LOOK AT TERRY  McAULIFFE, THE DEMOCRATIC  NOMINEE, AND CUCCINELLI YOU SEE  THE DIFFERENCE. TAKE A LISTEN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; JUST RECENTLY MY OPPONENT KEN CUCCINELLI WAS CAMPAIGNING AT A  GATHERING OF HIS SUPPORTERS WITH TED CRUZ. HE REFUSED TO STAND UP FOR  VIRGINIA AND AGAINST TED CRUZ&#39;S  SHUTDOWN STRATEGY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WE NEED PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT  NOVEMBER 5th -- THAT NOVEMBER  5th IS A REFERENDUM IN VIRGINIA  ON OBAMA CARE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THIS IS THE TED CRUZ Nth  EVENT IN ESSENCE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YEAH. AT ONE POINT HE WAS AFRAID TO  TAKE A PICTURE WITH CRUZ BUT  SUPPORTS ALL OF HIS POLICIES. VIRGINIA WAS THE HARDEST HIT  STATE BY THE SHUTDOWN. HE WASN&#39;T LOOKING OUT FOR HIS  CONSTITUENTS AND TERRY McAULIFFE HAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THIS. THIS IS TOTALLY ABOUT 2016 FOR  TED CRUZ. THERE HE IS IN IOWA, THE FIRST  CAUCUS STATE, APPEALING TO THE  FAR RIGHT OF THAT CAUCUS --  THOSE AVID CAUCUS GOERS. THEY&#39;RE OUT OF THE MAINSTREAM,  BUT THEY CAN CONCEIVABLY MAKE  HIM A PRESIDENT. AND SO HE&#39;S OUT THERE LIKE AN  INFOMERCIAL GUY WITH HIS  MICROPHONE CLIPPED TO HIS SUIT  AND TOSSING OUT RED MEAT AND  PLATITUDES. LOOKING LIKE SOMEBODY THINKING  ABOUT HIMSELF AND NOT HIS PARTY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; CONGRESSMAN, THIS IS NOT ONLY ABOUT 2016 FOR TED CRUZ. IT IS BAD FOR THE REPUBLICAN  PARTY. FOR EXAMPLE, RICK SANTORUM IS  GETTING HEADLINES FOR SAYING  THAT TED CRUZ&#39;S SHUTDOWN ANTICS  HURT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. LISTEN TO SANTORUM YESTERDAY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I WOULD SAY THAT IN THE END  HE DID MORE HARM. I THINK IT WAS NOT HIS  OBJECTIVE. I THINK HIS OBJECTIVE WAS AN  AUTOMOBILE ONE. I DON&#39;T THINK HE DID A GOOD JOB  POINTING IT OUT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; FOUR STRAIGHT POLLS, FOUR  STRAIGHT POLLS, CONGRESSMAN,  SINCE THE SHUTDOWN ALL SHOW THE  APPROVAL OF THE REPUBLICAN  PARTY&#39;S AT A RECORD LOW. SO IT&#39;S NOT ONLY ABOUT CRUZ &#39;16. HE IS BRINGING THE PARTY DOWN  WITH HIS ANTICS AND THOSE  AGREEABLE TO THEM. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HE IS. AND THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IS YOU HAVE REPUBLICANS LIKE JOHN  McCAIN, LIKE LINDSEY GRAHAM AND  KARL ROVE AND OTHERS WE&#39;VE HEARD WHO UNDERSTAND THE DAMAGE HE&#39;S  DOING TO THE PARTY AND THIS  EXTREME ELEMENT IN THAT PARTY IS THEIR REBRANDING. NOW THERE&#39;S SERIOUS CONCERN  AMONG HOUSE REPUBLICANS THAT  THEY WILL LOSE KROG OF THE HOUSE NEXT YEAR. AND THAT&#39;S ALL PART OF THIS  WHOLE INTERNAL DISPUTE THEY&#39;RE  HAVING IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; BUT YOU CALLED OUT THE SCARE  TACTICS ON OBAMA CARE. HERE&#39;S WHAT AMERICANS HAVE HEARD FROM THE RIGHT WING. LISTEN TO THIS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; MEN AND WOMEN HAVE LOOKED ME  IN THE EYES SAYING I&#39;M SCARED  FOR THIS COUNTRY, MY KIDS, MY  GRAND KIDS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; HUNDREDS OF E-MAILS AND PHONE CALLS EXPRESSING FEAR OF OBAMA  CARE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; INDIVIDUALS FEAR IT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE FEAR IS THAT ONLY THE  SICK WILL PAY TO JOIN THE  EXCHANGE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; WHICH HEALTH CARE PLAN CAN  YOU AFFORD SO YOU CAN SEE YOUR  DOCTORS? THIS IS WHAT KEEPS PARENTS AWAKE AT NIGHT FEARFUL THAT LIFE IS  NOT GOING TO WORK OUT THE WAY  THEY HOPED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; NOW, THESE SCARE TACTICS,  CONGRESSMAN, AND SCARE RHETORIC  IS OUT THERE. AND THERE HAS BEEN, IN FAIRNESS, GLITCHES IN THE ROLLOUT. BUT IN YOUR STATE OF KENTUCKY,  OBAMA CARE IN KENTUCKY IS A  GENUINE SUCCESS STORY. THE STATE COMMITTED TO BUILDING  ITS OWN SITE AND IT&#39;S PAYING  OFF. MORE THAN 26,000 PEOPLE IN THE  STATE HAVE ENROLLED, 50,000  APPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN STARTED,  MORE THAN 300,000 PEOPLE HAVE  VISITED THE WEBSITE. I MEAN, THIS IS HAPPENING IN A  STATE WITH 625,000 UNINSURED  PEOPLE. SO THIS IS A REAL, REAL SERIOUS  START, ISN&#39;T IT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. AND I THINK MORE IMPORTANTLY 400 BUSINESSES HAVE ALREADY FOUND  INSURANCE FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES  THROUGH THE KENTUCKY CONNECT. AND THAT&#39;S ALL PRIVATE  INSURANCE. IT&#39;S NOT BAD FOR BUSINESSES. IT&#39;S GREAT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. THIS IS IN A STATE FOR WHICH THE LAST THREE YEARS RAND PAUL AND  MITCH McCONNELL HAVE DONE  NOTHING BUT TRY TO MISLEAD MY  CONSTITUENTS AND THE REST OF THE CITIZENS OF KENTUCKY ABOUT THE  BENEFITS OF OBAMA CARE. SO NEXT YEAR WHEN MITCH  McCONNELL&#39;S ON THE BALLOT NEXT  YEAR, ALL OF HIS CLAIMS ARE  GOING TO RUN UP AGAINST THE  REALITY AND THE EXPERIENCE THAT  KENTUCKIANS HAVE HAD. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; ISN&#39;T THAT THE FEAR, JOAN,  THAT AS THIS THING COMES INTO  FRUITION THAT IT BECOMES  SUCCESSFUL AND THIS BECOMES A  GREAT POLITICAL BACKFIRE FOR THE REPUBLICANS? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YES. THAT IS THEIR FEAR. THAT&#39;S WHY THEY&#39;VE WORKED SO  HARD TO STOP IT. THEY COMPLAIN ABOUT WEBSITE  GLITCHES BUT THEY&#39;VE THROWN  EVERY OBSTACLE IN THE WAY OF THE PRESIDENT. THEY&#39;RE TERRIBLY AFRAID OF IT. IT&#39;S TOO EARLY TO SAY IT&#39;S GOING TO BE A SMASHING SUCCESS, BUT  FROM WHAT WE KNOW ALREADY IS A  LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GETTING CARE  THAT DIDN&#39;T HAVE IT.","media$content":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":563.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":0,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/2m1VhzrlO5Fb?feed=PoliticsNation","plfile$width":0,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":500000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":563.23,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":240,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/DfA97Osj4Wo2?feed=PoliticsNation","plfile$width":420,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""},{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":800000,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"video","plfile$duration":563.23,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"MPEG4","plfile$height":360,"plfile$isDefault":false,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/KJjtS1SEVWA2?feed=PoliticsNation","plfile$width":640,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"media$thumbnails":[{"plfile$audioChannels":0,"plfile$audioSampleRate":0,"plfile$bitrate":0,"plfile$checksums":{},"plfile$contentType":"image","plfile$duration":0.0,"plfile$expression":"full","plfile$fileSize":0,"plfile$frameRate":0.0,"plfile$format":"JPEG","plfile$height":1080,"plfile$isDefault":true,"plfile$language":"","plfile$sourceTime":0.0,"plfile$url":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_sharp_1walsh_131028.jpg","plfile$width":1920,"plfile$displayAspectRatio":""}],"link":"","pubDate":1383004020000,"plmedia$defaultThumbnailUrl":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/n_sharp_1walsh_131028.jpg","nnd$associatedPlaylist":{"href":"http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_44263878"},"nnd$brand":"MSNBC","nnd$bureau":"30RockNY","nnd$bviAssetId":"n_sharp_1walsh_131028","nnd$canonicalUrl":{"href":"http://www.msnbc.com/politicsnation/watch/the-gops-ted-cruz-problem-58082371950"},"nnd$distributionProfile":["MSN-CA","AWE"],"nnd$firstAiredAtUtc":1382997608000,"nnd$lastAiredAtUtc":1382997608000,"nnd$lastEditorialChangeAtUtc":1383004080000,"nnd$longTitle":"The GOP’s Ted Cruz problem","nnd$playCount30":4856,"nnd$playCountDay":37,"nnd$playCountYear":4863,"nnd$requiresCaptioning":true,"nnd$shortDescription":"Ted Cruz insists that the Republican party’s biggest problem is that they aren’t extreme enough.
